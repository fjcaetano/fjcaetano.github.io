<div class="entry-content">
  <p>I believe that every iOS developer is already aware of Apple’s new directive
forbidding any <em>apps</em> using <em>frame</em> to be submitted to the Appstore when the new
iOS 7 goes public. That means that ALL new <em>app</em> will have be developed using
this tool created by the son of a devil called <em>autolayout</em>.</p>

<p>Anyone that has already used <em>autolayout</em> knows that margin, width, height and
other properties are calculated in runtime, therefore, they consume sometimes
unnecessary CPU time. For some inescrutable reason, Apple decided to create this
new concept from scratch to ease working with different sized screens, while
they could easily reuse existing CSS concepts like <em>margin</em>, <em>padding</em>, among
others. In addition to being extremely confusing (a <code>UIView's</code> margin
<em>constraints</em> are in its <em>superview</em>), having a pitiful syntax 
<code>(“V:|-(-5)-[view1]-(&gt;=10)-[view2]-(912837)-|”)</code>, <em>autolayout</em> also makes
 everything slow.</p>

<p><strong>Protip:</strong> if you’re configuring your <em>coinstraints</em> via code, <strong>never</strong> forget
seting <code>self.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO</code> in your view. It
took me a couple of coffee cups to realise this was the reason why my 
<em>constraints</em> weren’t being executing along with <code>[self layoutIfNeeded]</code>.</p>

<p>I recently had to work with a <code>UICollectionView</code> and the scroll was getting
really laggy. Anytime a new cell was loaded, the framerate dropped. After
spending a few hours trying to find the root of the problem with a couple of
friends (we even considered the problem being the SDK’s <code>dequeue</code> thanks to 
<em>Profiler</em>) some inspired insight hit us and we decided to disable <em>autolayout</em>
on the <code>UICollectionViewCell's</code> xib and everything flowed like a beautiful
stream under the morning sunlight of tropical woods. So let us analise what
happened: Apple created a new concept, from the grounds, that theoretically
would solve all problems when working with screens of different sizes, but this
devilish concept is composed of runtime calculated values that ruin the <em>app’s</em>
smoothness. Yep, it gets hard to work happily…</p>

<p>This view that is the <code>UICollectionView's</code> cell will not have <em>autolayout</em>.
Nobody knows what will happen when we submit the <em>app</em> to the Appstore and we
sincerely hope that Apple doesn’t mind this view that, although is not
explicitly using <em>frames</em>, also is not configured to accept <em>autolayout</em>.</p>

<p>I’m yet to find an iOS developer that has nothing to complain about this weird
invention, but, as usual, Apple’s “this is what we want, so deal with it” policy
doesn’t give us any alternatives. Instead of easing developers’ work, they’re
making our daily lives every more difficult while <del>Android scores another
point</del> Apple is walking backwards.</p>

  <p>In any kind of environment, visual marks ease and enhance the comprehension of
information. Countless researches studied the best way to display data, which
colors induce what emotions, the association of geometric shapes with pre-formed
concepts. The fact is that a sign or plaque draws much more attention than plain
text. After all, an image is worth a thousand words, therefore, an image sends a
much more significant message than some written words.</p>

<p>That’s one of the reasons many development tools have featured <em>badges</em> (or 
<em>shields)</em> to inform the status of an application/framework/library/<em>etcetera</em>.
It’s the case of <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/status-images/">Travis CI</a>, 
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/changelog/510d4fde56b102523a0004bf">Code Climate</a>, 
<a href="http://blog.tech-angels.com/post/43141047457/gemnasium-v3-aka-gemnasium">Gemnasium</a>,
among others, all following <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/shields">olivierlacan/shields`</a>
trend, available Github.</p>

<p>I’m an iOS developer and previously have worked with Python/Django (though I
still fool around) and I’ve always found very interesting this creative way of
sharing the state of a service dynamically, but sadly, there were no solution to
Python nor iOS featuring <em>badges</em> (except for Travis CI for tests). But,
recently, appeared - out of nowhere - <a href="https://pypip.in/">pypip’s</a> <em>shields</em> for
Python packages that allows the visualisation of the latest available version of
a package on <a href="http://pypi.python.org">pypi</a> or how many downloads some <em>release
*had</em>.* When I came aware if it I resented for taking so long for solution so
simple and effective to come up (or at least for <strong>I</strong> to discover it)… but it
got over the top when I found out… or better, <strong>did not found out</strong> a similar
solution for <a href="http://cocoapods.org">Cocoapods</a>.</p>

<p>I’m one of those who doesn’t miss a chance to solve a problem and endeavour an
opportunity. That’s how the <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/cocoapod-badges/">Cocoapod Badges</a> 
project started. Since Cocoapods doesn’t provide an API, any info on the number
of <em>users/downloads</em>, nor any kind of useful data, it proved to be a challenge,
and all I could use had to be what was at hand: the latest version of a <em>pod</em>.
But even though, mistaken are those who thought it easy. As mentioned, there’s
no API!</p>

<h1 id="cocoapod-badgesnsstringmask-112httpscocoapod-badgesherokuappcomvnsstringmaskbadgepng">Cocoapod Badges <img src="https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/NSStringMask/badge.png" alt="NSStringMask 1.1.2" /></h1>

<p>Digging through Cocoapod’s and <a href="http://cocoadocs.org">Cocoadocs’</a> websites, I
tried, first, to use the <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/documents.jsonp">documents.jsonp</a> 
file that I found in the <em>source</em> of the <em>pod</em>’s documentation website, however,
I soon gave up for realising that its update frequency is too high (above one
hour). At last, I had to content with the unfortunate <code>/search?q=</code> requested
when searching for a <em>pod</em> in Cocoapod’s main page. At first, it looked like an
excellent solution since it returned a <code>json</code> object with some info, until I
realised that inside the object was a string with some <code>html</code> code and only
inside that code was the <em>pod</em>’s latest version. “<em>God dammit!</em>” Now I have to
run a request on a “pseudo-<em>webservice</em>” and parse it with <code>XPATH</code> to get the
latest version!</p>

<p>Super easy! But, as my mother would on a brazilian saying: “<em>few shit is
silliness</em>”. The damned “API” doesn’t return the requested <em>pod</em>, but anything
with the searched string. To get something more useful, I figured that 
<code>/search?q=name:POD_NAME</code> searches only in the <em>pod</em>’s name and not in its
description, what significantly reduces the results, specially when dealing with
popular <em>pods</em> such as <a href="http://afnetworking.github.io/AFNetworking/index.html">AFNetworking</a>.</p>

<p>After all that suffering, I finally got the information I wanted, but then, how
do I show it in an image? Olivier Lacan’s repo, that enabled all the existing 
<em>badges,</em> provides, beyond the <em>.png</em> to existing services, <code>.SVG</code> vectorial
files that render <code>xml</code> data to images. So, accidentally, I double-clicked the 
<code>.SVG</code> file and the holy Google Chrome opened it as an image! Finally good news!
As the information about the version is in plain text inside the <code>xml</code>, all I
had to do was to set the <code>mimetype</code> so Django could provide the file as an image.</p>

<p>1 <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> <em>dyno</em> later and the service is available fulltime
(depending on Cocoapods website) through the images’ url:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>http://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/$PODNAME/badge.png</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All you have to do is replace the <code>$PODNAME</code> with the name of the pod you want.
Simple and easy, isn’t it? Use it at will! And suport the Github repo!</p>

    </h1>
  
</header>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>This is an article I originally wrote for the brazilian online magazine
<a href="http://www.devmedia.com.br/aprenda-a-documentar-seus-projetos-em-objective-c-revista-mobile-magazine-48/27964">DevMedia’s Mobile Magazine</a>.
This first part is the article’s introduction, so seat back and relax. Soon I’ll
post the second - and final - part with a tutorial to the Apple like
documentation generator <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>.</p>

<p>“In the agile programming environment, using methodologies such as SCRUM, Agile
and Lean, we can’t always document our sources. After all, pragmatics as we
developers are, why would we lose time if the documentation won’t be compiled,
won’t do any difference in the code’s performance and demands a considerable
slice of our time? But despite all that, the lack of documentation hurts. A lot.</p>

<p>Who’s familiarised, knows that in the ultra accelerated rhythm of <em>startups</em>,
where everything is at the top of the list, there’s not always time to apply
some of the good programming technics that aren’t crucial to the sanity and
speed of the code. Oftenly, there’s no time to formally test classes and methods
because of the virtually null due time that is given. It’s easy to find
developers awake all night in <em>hackatons</em> to successfully deliver <em>that key</em>
feature that will make “the whole difference”. Test? Document? Review? There’s
so much to do and so little time!</p>

<p>That’s the reality of many young developers who enter this ultra competitive
environment searching for the dream of running their own companies. The
responsibilty of satisfying potential investors, the pressure for deploys and
the client’s needs frequently obfuscate technics that improve development and
maintenance experiences, but that are not considered primordial to the
construction of an application. How often didn’t I went back to an undocumented
code done less than two months before and thought “<em>what the flock does this
loop do?</em>” or “<em>why, on earth, is this class here and not there?</em>” Of course,
when those lines of code were written, everything made perfect sense, but the
moment those <em>ifs</em> and <em>fors</em> went out of the conscious mind, their meaning were
long gone. After all, quoting the chinese saying: “<em>the ink is better than memory</em>”.</p>

<p>So let us document. It doesn’t hurt, doesn’t make you fat and isn’t illegal.
Actually, documenting is like eating vegetables: no one really likes it, but we
do it hopping that, in the end, it’s worth the result. But unlike the vegetables,
it’s proved that documenting helps. Contrary to the common thought, the time
spent documenting a day’s work is reasonably irrelevant and the benefit in return
is definitely worthy. With practice and experience, no more than 30 minutes can
be lost documenting everything that was made in a whole day. That way, the
developer stays focused in his activity and doesn’t deviates doing other stuff
that draws his attention or stand in his way of writing the best possible
algorithm. Therefore, don’t wait until the end of the week, when the work pile
up, part of the features were already forgotten and we’re all dying to that
ice-cold friday-night-beer. Personally, I recommend documenting in the end of
the day. In my case, it’s always the last thing I do before leaving, because
everything is still fresh in memory and the amount of code produced in one day
doesn’t compare to what’s done in one week. If that’s not enough, I realised
that I do a final unconscious revision before the final <em>commit</em> when I’m
passing by the code documenting it.</p>

<p>A well documented code is good for everybody. What would be of us without the
independent frameworks, packages and repositories used daily if they weren’t
documented, or even had a bad documentation? Even senior programmers, frequently,
return to Apple’s documentation to a better understanding of Cocoa’s classes.
Whether consulting a less used protocol, or lower level functions to manage
<em>sockets</em>, <em>threads</em> or <em>semaphores</em>. Nobody can remember everything, so don’t
try it, you’re not an elephant. It’s not rare to find developers who use the
documentation as a last resource to understanding some tool. This line of thought
makes sense if we think that we want everything to be as explained as possible
so we don’t lose any time trying to interpretate any possible use, when trying
to comprehend some feature. But we must never forget that even when visiting
forums, asking more experienced developers or reading articles in blogs,
EVERYTHING had a documentation as basis. Well, even this article wouldn’t exist
if wasn’t for <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>’s documentation.</p>

<p>Documenting - or at least commenting - source codes is fundamental to the
intelligibility of the code. Implementing these technics with developers that
never done it, oftenly is seen with prejudice and suspicion that are common to
the staunch and stubborn nature of young programmers. I must confess that I
didn’t wanted to document when people first told me to. Moreover, because of
it’s so unusual syntax, it’s interesting to verbalize what’s developed in ObjC
to ease it’s lecture, specially by more unexperienced programmers.</p>

<p>As time goes by, with the expansion of the <em>startup</em>, the pressure and need of
code documentation is felt. Contrary to many programming languages - such as
Java with it’s hideous GUI Javadoc - Objective-C doesn’t have an “official”
documentation generator. In our <em>quest</em> to find a differentiated framework, which
could make us feel as if we were really making difference, we found the excellent
<a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a> that, using code comments <em>à la</em>
Javadoc, generates Apple like documentation, with a docset <em>automagically</em>
installed in XCode, static HTML sources which can be uploaded to a cloud (<em>vide</em> 
<a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/1.1.2/">NSStringMask</a> which uses
<a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>) and an interface identical to Cocoa’s.</p>

<p>Among <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>)’s already described advantages,
are also the documentation parsing through code comments, wich allow the developer
to consult the documentation without the need of opening a new window, since
everything is in the code. The integration with XCode allows the visualisation of
tooltips with quick access to the documentation by simply holding the <em>Option</em>
key and clicking a method or class. Moreover, by “compiling” <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>)
in your documented project, the library’s docset is already imported to your
<em>Organizer</em>. Simple or not? But, undoubtedly, <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>)’s
main advantage is it’s interface that’s identical to Apple’s documentation. I
think it’s very unlikely that there’s any ObjC developer that has never read
Cocoa’s documentation, be the one embedded on XCode or the on in Apples developers
portal. By reusing the known model, it terminates the problem of having to
familiarise to a new layout.”</p>

<p>Soon I’ll be posting the second part with a tutorial.</p>

  <p>When developing, we often come across code we’ve seen hundreds of times that we
just copy and paste from project to project. Sometimes it’s so banal that it’s
not worth trying to improve, change or even modularize it. Ctrl-C + Ctrl-V may
be the cheapest and fastest solution, ergo, the best.</p>

<p>This is the kind of situation we see when masks must be applied to <em>text fields</em>
such as Social Security Numbers (SSN), Telephones, Zip Codes, and so on. Those
awful few dozens of lines we copy from one <code>textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString:</code>
to the other. It never changes because it works. There’s no need to improve it.
It’s always the same. But I’ve got tired of it. That nasty code that, in a well
structured class, can be as a mole in a beautiful woman’s face.</p>

<p>A few days ago I got some spare time and I started working on something I though
could come handy. So how do you simplify and generalise this problem that every
developer has to face at least once? Easy! <em>Regex</em>! Wait.. You sure it’s easy? I’ll
tell you, it wasn’t easy, but we’re talking about patterns in varying occasions
and, as I visualised it, <em>regex</em> is the best, simplest and most “approachable”
solution. I mean, everybody knows a little bit of <em>regex</em>.</p>

<p>While modelling, I wanted to make it as simple and as clean as possible, therefore,
for now, there are only two classes, and only one method you’ll really use, but
you can read the <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/">complete documentation</a>.
From now on, I’ll present a superficial approach to introduce this small library.</p>

<p>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/NSStringMask">Github Repo</a>!</p>

<h2 id="nsstringmask">NSStringMask</h2>

<p>The NSStringMask is the main class responsible for applying your masks to the
NSStrings. Among it’s methods the only noteworthy is
<a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/Classes/NSStringMask.html#//api/name/maskString:withPattern:placeholder:"><code>[NSStringMask maskString:withPattern:placeholder:]</code></a>.</p>

<p>It formats the given <code>string</code> based on the <code>pattern</code> you provide, filling the
voids with the <code>placeholder</code>. It automatically creates an instance of
NSRegularExpression with the option <code>CaseInsensitive</code>, so if you need a different
option, you may use the alternate method which expects a <em>regex</em> instead of <code>pattern</code>.</p>

<p>There’s also an alternative method that receives no <code>placeholder</code> (same as <code>nil</code>),
in this case, when the given <code>string</code> is shorter than expected, instead of
applying the mask, the method will return a cleaned <em>string</em> having only the
valid characters based on <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/Classes/NSStringMask.html#//api/name/validCharactersForString:"><code>validCharactersForString:</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="important-note">Important Note</h3>

<p>Doesn’t matter if providing a <code>pattern</code> or an instance of <em>regex</em>, the regular
expression <strong>must</strong> have capturing groups (parentheses). This is because the
class understands that everything that is not within parentheses is part of the
mask and must be interpreted as literal characters!</p>

<p>Suppose you’re formatting a SSN, whose <em>regex</em> pattern is <code>\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{3}</code>.
If you provide that <em>regex</em>/pattern, nothing will be formatted because the class
will think that <code>\d{3}</code> is part of the mask, and not 3 numbers that should go there.</p>

<p>The correct usage is: <code>(\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{3})</code></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span class="c1">// RIGHT:</span>
<span class="bp">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="nl">maskString</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;12345678&quot;</span> <span class="nl">withPattern</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;(\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{3})&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="c1">// result = @&quot;123-45-678&quot;</span>

<span class="c1">// WRONG:</span>
<span class="bp">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="nl">maskString</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;12345678&quot;</span> <span class="nl">withPattern</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{3}&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="c1">// result = nil</span></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Obs</strong>: If Xcode is showing a <em>warning</em> about unknown escape sequences, try
adding double slashes (<code>\\d</code>)</p>

<h2 id="uitextfieldmask">UITextFieldMask</h2>

<p>This is a subclass of UITextField, so you can set your <em>nibs</em> to use this class
and automatically apply masks to your <em>text fields</em>.</p>

<p>Obviously, you must provide a mask to transform your <em>strings</em>, and it’s
recommended that you do so when initialising your <em>view</em> or <em>view controller</em>.
So you should set the text field’s mask inside <code>viewDidLoad</code> or <code>awakeFromNib</code>.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a <em>view</em> with an <em>outlet</em> to an UITextFieldMask named <code>textFieldMask</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span class="p">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">awakeFromNib</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">mask</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="nl">maskWithPattern</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;(\d+)&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>

    <span class="n">textFieldMask</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">mask</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mask</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">textFieldMask</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">delegate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>A question for you: what does that mask accepts?</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>You can install it from <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/NSStringMask">Cocoa Pods</a>,
or clone the project from the <a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/NSStringMask">Github Repo</a>
and copy the files in the folder <code>Classes</code>.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>Tired of having to find out where an exception occurred, that was only captured
in the <em>main()</em>? Now I’m going to show you the best Xcode tip that no one talks
about. Don’t ask me why.</p>

<p>These are the very few steps that will save your life and make your day better.</p>

<h2 id="creating-an-exception-breakpoint">Creating an “Exception Breakpoint”</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to access the Breakpoint Navigator, which is the little
breakpoint marker on the top of your Project Navigator. If you didn’t know, the
Breakpoint Navigator show all your breakpoints in your project, where you can
easily manage them. (Click on the image to see it bigger)</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-1.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-1.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-1" /></a></p>

<p>Now that you’re in the Breakpoint Navigator, click on the little “+” button on
the bottom left of the screen. A little dialog window will show up and choose the
“Add Exception Breakpoint…” option.</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-3.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-3.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-3" /></a></p>

<p>Then, the Xcode will ask you some information about the breakpoint you’re creating:</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-4.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-4.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-4" /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Exception: There are three options: “All” to get all types of exceptions; “C++” to get only C++ exceptions; and “Objective-C” to get only ObjC exceptions. I like to leave it as “All”.</li>
  <li>Break: Leave it as “On Throw”. This way, the execution will stop when your code throws an exception and not when it catches, which is the default on <em>main()</em>.</li>
  <li>Action: You can set some action to be performed when the breakpoint is reached like run an Apple Script, shell command and others. I’ve never used it.</li>
  <li>Options: if you check this option, your code won’t stop when the breakpoint hits, making it useless. So leave it unchecked.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully created an Exception Breakpoint that will
stop whenever something odd happens! Let’s try it out!</p>

<p>As an example I’ve created an empty array and tried to access the object at index
0, which doesn’t exists. This is what happened:</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-5.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-5.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-5" /></a></p>

<p>Whoa! The Xcode stopped precisely where the problem was! Quite awesome, huh? But,
sometimes, it’s not that easy to visualise what the problem really is, so if
that’s happening to you, just hit “<em>play</em>”, and the code will keep executing as
if your breakpoint doesn’t exists. What happens now, is the <em>main()</em> catching
whatever exceptions that may happen.</p>

<p>So you can look at the console to see what the problem was:</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-6.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-6.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-6" /></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>”-[__NSArrayI objectAtIndex:]: index 0 beyond bounds for empty array”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ta daa! I know it’s not perfect. It won’t get any <em>signals</em> (SIGABRT, SIGTRAP),
<em>flags</em> or <em>bad access</em> kinds of witchcraft, but I think it’s super helpful and
I think you guys should know.</p>
