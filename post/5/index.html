<div class="entry-content">
  <p>SQLite sucks. I think everybody knows, but I had to say it. But, sometimes, we
have no choice other than using it. Even though it’s horrible and we know we`ll
be frustrated, once in a lifetime, SQLite may be the best choice. Wether developing
a program with a tiny or fast persistence. Sure there are other alternatives that
may suit you best, but the platform we’re using may not support it.</p>

<p>For instance, I’m currently working on an iPad app that will have a fairly big
amount of data which must be available offline and it will have to be updated
sometimes. The best solution we came with is a background server task wich will
build an SQLite database populated with the most recent data and, when the user
requests, the iPad will download the whole database, overwriting any existing ones.</p>

<p>I’m no DBA, but I don’t think anyone writes database creation scripts anymore.
At least not for the usual <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, etc. I’m mostly a MySQL guy and, for
a long time, I’ve been using <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a>
to create my DB models and syncing with my existing database. It automatically
creates everything that needs to be created and alter all tables that must be
altered without losing any data (most of the time). It’s pretty good and I never
had any problems with it.</p>

<p>Now, back to listing reasons why SQLite sucks (dude, you can’t add a constraint
when altering a table!). As any platform/framework with no “official” team, SQLite
depends on the community to increase it’s awesomeness. Therefore, as everybody
knows SQLite <em>is not awesome</em>, no one really waste time developing a <em>good</em>
administration tool for it. What may happen, is a company own a DB management
program (such as <a href="http://www.navicat.com/">Navicat</a>) and something like this goes by:</p>

<pre><code>- Hey, we're supporting MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Cassandra, NoSQL and Postgree,
don't you think people will notice we're ignoring SQLite?

- God dammit *gasps*, add support to it too... but don't lose too much time with it!
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, there are no really good tools to work with SQLite available.
“Hey, what about <a href="http://www.navicat.com/">Navicat</a>?” It’s okay, but I found tons
of bugs in the Mac version. If that’s not enough, are you really willing to pay
to use a management tool for a free, open source database? But if you search deep
enough - like the 3rd page of Google - there are also some weird stuff that
appears such as <a href="http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/">SQLiteStudio</a> (for Mac). When I see
things I like that I think “why the hell would people lose time developing
something for SQLite?” But hey, there are weirdos for everything, so I’d like to
thank for the <a href="http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/">SQLiteStudio</a> team for being strange
enough to create it.</p>

<p>Even though it’s not the best tool ever, <a href="http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/">SQLiteStudio</a>
sure comes in handy and helps a lot, but it doesn’t solve the mentioned problem
of modelling your SQLite database and not dealing with SQL scripts. So, searching
for something that would fill this void I found <a href="http://www.henlich.de/software/sqlite-export-plugin-for-mysql-workbench/">this excellent script</a>
in Lua for <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> that
<em>automagically</em> generates the SQLite CREATE script from a model. It’s super easy
to install and use. Just follow this steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the .lua script (duh!)</li>
  <li>Click in the “Scripting” menu in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a>.</li>
  <li>Click “Install Plugin/Module”.</li>
  <li>Choose the downloaded .lua script.</li>
  <li>???</li>
  <li>Profit.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Now, if you want to try, open a model, click the “Plugins” menu and
under “Utilities” there must be an option named “Export SQLite CREATE Script”
which may be the first one. Just click it and choose where to save the .sql script
and execute it. <em>Voilà</em>! If you have any problems executing the generated script,
you may need to comment the <code>BEGIN;</code> at the top and the <code>COMMIT;</code> at the bottom
of the .sql script.</p>

<p>Super easy, isn’t it? Give it a try. Even if, like me, you hate SQLite. The plugin
solves the modelling problem, but creates a new one, because you can’t <code>ALTER</code> an
existing table since it only generates the <code>CREATE</code> script. But if that’s not a
problem go for it and be happy. When I found it, life suddenly became joyful again.</p>

    </h1>
  
</header>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>“Once upon a time, there was a tiny invisible force named <em>Luck</em>. Everybody loved
it and gave it gifts, hoping that, when needed, <em>Luck</em> would come for them. But
<em>Luck</em> had a younger sibling called <em>Bad Luck</em>, who hated <em>Luck</em> with all it’s
strength and always tried to be the opposite of <em>Luck</em>, because, while everybody
smiled and cheered for <em>Luck</em>, no one liked when <em>Bad Luck</em> was around. People
twisted their noses at <em>Bad Luck</em> and everybody blamed it for every bad thing that
happened in their lives.”</p>

<p>This is that time of year when joy and happiness take over people. Some folks are
going on vacations and we won’t see again for a while, and every single one of
them, without exception, while saying goodbye, wish “happy holidays, and good
luck!” If there’s one thing I can’t understand is this misconception people have
on <em>luck</em> and <em>bad luck</em>. I see all those people on new year’s eve wearing white,
jumping waves, and doing all kinds of foolishness hoping it “will bring them good
luck” and I can’t understand.</p>

<p>Luck isn’t something you can “force” or hope to come. “Luck” is the name we give
for a chain of events that, coincidentally, affect you in a good (<em>luckily</em>) or
bad (<em>unluckily</em>) way. Let’s picture an hypothetical scenario: you’re riding a
bike and, right before you cross another street, you hit a pedestrian. Was bad
luck that put that asshole there, right? Now, what if, one second after you hit
him, a car goes by at 60mph crossing the street you are at. Not so bad luck hitting
that good citizen now, huh? So, although the result is the same, the denomination
we give to that chain of events changed because of one single variable: some
douchebag driving his car while talking on the phone. So, what was bad luck for
you, became luck. But what about for that poor guy you hit? For him, independently
of the result, he’s still pretty banged up, so he <em>had</em> bad luck. It didn’t
randomly pointed at him and said “you, sir, are gonna get screwed!” It did just
happened. Bad Luck. When you do something that goes badly and you knew the odds
were against you, that’s not bad luck. It’s not the universe flipping you the
finger and screaming “fuck you, Jimmywobble!” That’s stupidity. <em>YOLO</em> my ass!</p>

<p>I not always wear white on new year’s eve, but when I do, it’s not because I think
it will bring me peace in the upcoming year. It’s because I want to get into the
spirit of the party. Those thousands of people in white, happy, drunk and with
the promise of better things to come are what drive me to join them and put on a
white shirt.</p>

<p>But don’t think I’m crazy just yet. If I’m walking down the street and I see a
ladder landing on a wall, of course I’ll pass around it. Not only I do not want
anything to fall on my head, but hey, what if I’m wrong? Why would I bet against
it when I don’t know if it will get angry and come back to bite me in the ass?</p>

<p>So, in this year’s ending, I wish that every single little incident that happens
to you in 2013 may be chained to good fortune. I hope that slam you’ll give with
your pinky finger in your table helps you find that earring you’re looking for
for three years. Or that tongue bite you’ll have may lead you into meeting some
super hot nurse.</p>

<p>So I wish you well in the new year. I hope you all the best.</p>

<p>And good luck.</p>

  <p>One of the main reasons I like Django is it’s awesome auto-generated admin
interface. It’s  just awesome. When you start to play with it and discover apps
like <a href="https://bitbucket.org/izi/django-admin-tools/wiki/Home">django-admin-tools</a>,
the faded <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-jqmobile/">jq-mobile</a> and other cool 
stuff you realise how versatile Django really is.</p>

<h1 id="the-context">The Context</h1>

<p>When I started learning Django I created a small manager for some of my hobbies.
The first one was a book manager in which I have a log of <strong>every single</strong> book
I’ve ever read, <strong>when</strong> I read it, <strong>where</strong> the book is located, if it’s 
<strong>borrowed</strong> to somebody, a “<strong>GIVE IT BACK TO ME</strong>” button that sends an email
with that exact message to whoever has it, and so on. Among everything, I also
added a field for the book’s <em>cover</em> but I never really used it.</p>

<p>More recently, I restarted to improve my card deck collection (yes, I’m weird)
and added this new feature to my Django manager. But this time, since it’s
cataloging a collection and decks are mainly visual, the photos of the decks are 
<strong><em>very</em></strong> important. Yes, I said image<strong><em>S</em></strong>. Each deck has five photos:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Front of the Box</li>
  <li>The Back of the Box</li>
  <li>The Back of the Cards</li>
  <li>The Joker</li>
  <li>The Ace of Spades</li>
</ul>

<p>There are decks with a different back for each card, but that’s not important,.
Those are the options I’m contemplating. But, since not all of them are opened
(I have one numbered deck that goes to 2500 copies. I won’t open it. Never!) only 
the first two images are requirements.</p>

<p>So, now that you are aware of the context, this is when the problem (and the fun) started.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>I started looking for some Django solution that could easily show thumbnails for
my images in my admin module. Guess what was my surprise when I realised there
was <em>N**one</em>.</p>

<p>There was absolutely nothing that would do what wanted and needed. The closest
things I found were the automatic thumbnail creator <a href="https://github.com/sorl/sorl-thumbnail">sorl-thumbnail</a>
and <a href="http://www.acedevs.com/blog/2011/07/11/django-admin-list-view-thumbnails/">Ace Devs solution</a> 
which didn’t solve my problem. Dude, my images have 1936x2592 pixels of resolution.
I can’t just show them as they are.</p>

<p>That’s when I realised I would have to develop a new solution for that.</p>

<h1 id="the-solution-aka-the-fun-part">The Solution (aka The Fun Part)</h1>

<p>I’m a modest guy, I don’t like bragging about what I do.</p>

<p>No forget it. Bullshit. I do like to show everyone what I did. Specially when I
think it’s awesome, I mean, It’s awesome. Don’t you like sharing awesome stuff
with your friends? Dude, I’m even writing an article about it! In <strong>TWO</strong> languages!</p>

<p>So, what I did was basically to join and improve those two solutions I found.
“<strong>Basically</strong>” because, in the deep, it was a little more complex than that.</p>

<p>I came up with the stupidest yet simplest name I could find:
<a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/django-admin-thumbnail">django-admin-thumbnail</a>. I
know, it’s über stupid. But it’s also simple, so it works.</p>

<h2 id="django-admin-thumbnail">django-admin-thumbnail</h2>

<p>The package automatically works on your <em>list_display</em> of your <em>ModelAdmin</em>. It
<em>automagically</em> detects your <em>ImageFields</em>, converts it to thumbnail (physically
allocated) using <a href="https://github.com/sorl/sorl-thumbnail">sorl-thumbnail</a> and
displays to you in a user friendly way.</p>

<p>This is how it looks when you hover your cursor over an <em>ImageField</em> in your model grid.</p>

<p><a href="/images/thumb_image.png"><img src="/images/thumb_image.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The image is in portuguese. Imagem = Image, Abrir Imagem = Open Image.
<a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/django-admin-thumbnail">django-admin-thumbnail</a> is
localizable but, currently, only <code>pt-BR</code> and <code>en-US</code> are the officially supported
languages. If you want it to be in your language, just send me your <code>.po</code> file
and I’ll validate it and share. It’s ridiculous, there are only two tags. Give it a try!</p>

<p>When I finished, I realised how simple and effective it was. I had to share it
with the community. So I took the opportunity to create my first <em>python package</em>.
It was a pain in the ass because the documentation is lame, specially the
<em>long-description</em> part. I had to generate it a zillion times to get the
<em>reStructured Text</em> working until I found the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2html">py2html</a> 
command.</p>

<h1 id="wrap-and-finish">Wrap and Finish</h1>

<p>That’s it. If you want to know more about <a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/django-admin-thumbnail">django-admin-thumbnail</a> 
just click the link and it will send you to the Github repository. There’s a
quick start guide. <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_admin_thumbnail/0.1.1">Here’s the link for the python package</a></p>

<p>If you have any trouble to use it, don’t hesitate to send me a message.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

  <p>Hi there, stranger.</p>

<p>If you found this blog, you’re probably my friend or already know what I do for
a living. But anyways I’m a mobile app developer (I mean, iOS developer), Python
fan and Django explorer.</p>

<p>In this blog, which I’ll try to update at least once a month, I’ll primarily talk
about my approaches in some aspects of my developer life, but if I digress and
start talking about karting, movies, cooking or anything, please, bare with me 
for I’ll eventually come back to topic – or not. Those are some of my current
hobbies and, in the future, more wil come and some will be forgotten.</p>

<p>That’s me. Oh, btw, my name is Flávio (duh!), I’m 22 brazilian and you can reach
me at <a href="mailto:flavio@vieiracaetano.com">flavio@vieiracaetano.com</a>.</p>

<p>These are some of my links you may find interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano">Github Profile</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://flaviocaetano.com">Personal Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/fl%C3%A1vio-j-vieira-caetano/1a/785/826">LinkedIn Profile</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it for now. Soon will finish the next article I’m currently working on
and, when I’m satisfied – which will probably be never, but I’ll post it anyway
– we’ll talk more.</p>

<p>See you next time.</p>
