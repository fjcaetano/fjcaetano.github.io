</header>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>This is an article I originally wrote for the brazilian online magazine
<a href="http://www.devmedia.com.br/aprenda-a-documentar-seus-projetos-em-objective-c-revista-mobile-magazine-48/27964">DevMedia’s Mobile Magazine</a>.
This first part is the article’s introduction, so seat back and relax. Soon I’ll
post the second - and final - part with a tutorial to the Apple like
documentation generator <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>.</p>

<p>“In the agile programming environment, using methodologies such as SCRUM, Agile
and Lean, we can’t always document our sources. After all, pragmatics as we
developers are, why would we lose time if the documentation won’t be compiled,
won’t do any difference in the code’s performance and demands a considerable
slice of our time? But despite all that, the lack of documentation hurts. A lot.</p>

<p>Who’s familiarised, knows that in the ultra accelerated rhythm of <em>startups</em>,
where everything is at the top of the list, there’s not always time to apply
some of the good programming technics that aren’t crucial to the sanity and
speed of the code. Oftenly, there’s no time to formally test classes and methods
because of the virtually null due time that is given. It’s easy to find
developers awake all night in <em>hackatons</em> to successfully deliver <em>that key</em>
feature that will make “the whole difference”. Test? Document? Review? There’s
so much to do and so little time!</p>

<p>That’s the reality of many young developers who enter this ultra competitive
environment searching for the dream of running their own companies. The
responsibilty of satisfying potential investors, the pressure for deploys and
the client’s needs frequently obfuscate technics that improve development and
maintenance experiences, but that are not considered primordial to the
construction of an application. How often didn’t I went back to an undocumented
code done less than two months before and thought “<em>what the flock does this
loop do?</em>” or “<em>why, on earth, is this class here and not there?</em>” Of course,
when those lines of code were written, everything made perfect sense, but the
moment those <em>ifs</em> and <em>fors</em> went out of the conscious mind, their meaning were
long gone. After all, quoting the chinese saying: “<em>the ink is better than memory</em>”.</p>

<p>So let us document. It doesn’t hurt, doesn’t make you fat and isn’t illegal.
Actually, documenting is like eating vegetables: no one really likes it, but we
do it hopping that, in the end, it’s worth the result. But unlike the vegetables,
it’s proved that documenting helps. Contrary to the common thought, the time
spent documenting a day’s work is reasonably irrelevant and the benefit in return
is definitely worthy. With practice and experience, no more than 30 minutes can
be lost documenting everything that was made in a whole day. That way, the
developer stays focused in his activity and doesn’t deviates doing other stuff
that draws his attention or stand in his way of writing the best possible
algorithm. Therefore, don’t wait until the end of the week, when the work pile
up, part of the features were already forgotten and we’re all dying to that
ice-cold friday-night-beer. Personally, I recommend documenting in the end of
the day. In my case, it’s always the last thing I do before leaving, because
everything is still fresh in memory and the amount of code produced in one day
doesn’t compare to what’s done in one week. If that’s not enough, I realised
that I do a final unconscious revision before the final <em>commit</em> when I’m
passing by the code documenting it.</p>

<p>A well documented code is good for everybody. What would be of us without the
independent frameworks, packages and repositories used daily if they weren’t
documented, or even had a bad documentation? Even senior programmers, frequently,
return to Apple’s documentation to a better understanding of Cocoa’s classes.
Whether consulting a less used protocol, or lower level functions to manage
<em>sockets</em>, <em>threads</em> or <em>semaphores</em>. Nobody can remember everything, so don’t
try it, you’re not an elephant. It’s not rare to find developers who use the
documentation as a last resource to understanding some tool. This line of thought
makes sense if we think that we want everything to be as explained as possible
so we don’t lose any time trying to interpretate any possible use, when trying
to comprehend some feature. But we must never forget that even when visiting
forums, asking more experienced developers or reading articles in blogs,
EVERYTHING had a documentation as basis. Well, even this article wouldn’t exist
if wasn’t for <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>’s documentation.</p>

<p>Documenting - or at least commenting - source codes is fundamental to the
intelligibility of the code. Implementing these technics with developers that
never done it, oftenly is seen with prejudice and suspicion that are common to
the staunch and stubborn nature of young programmers. I must confess that I
didn’t wanted to document when people first told me to. Moreover, because of
it’s so unusual syntax, it’s interesting to verbalize what’s developed in ObjC
to ease it’s lecture, specially by more unexperienced programmers.</p>

<p>As time goes by, with the expansion of the <em>startup</em>, the pressure and need of
code documentation is felt. Contrary to many programming languages - such as
Java with it’s hideous GUI Javadoc - Objective-C doesn’t have an “official”
documentation generator. In our <em>quest</em> to find a differentiated framework, which
could make us feel as if we were really making difference, we found the excellent
<a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a> that, using code comments <em>à la</em>
Javadoc, generates Apple like documentation, with a docset <em>automagically</em>
installed in XCode, static HTML sources which can be uploaded to a cloud (<em>vide</em> 
<a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/1.1.2/">NSStringMask</a> which uses
<a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>) and an interface identical to Cocoa’s.</p>

<p>Among <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>)’s already described advantages,
are also the documentation parsing through code comments, wich allow the developer
to consult the documentation without the need of opening a new window, since
everything is in the code. The integration with XCode allows the visualisation of
tooltips with quick access to the documentation by simply holding the <em>Option</em>
key and clicking a method or class. Moreover, by “compiling” <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>)
in your documented project, the library’s docset is already imported to your
<em>Organizer</em>. Simple or not? But, undoubtedly, <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>)’s
main advantage is it’s interface that’s identical to Apple’s documentation. I
think it’s very unlikely that there’s any ObjC developer that has never read
Cocoa’s documentation, be the one embedded on XCode or the on in Apples developers
portal. By reusing the known model, it terminates the problem of having to
familiarise to a new layout.”</p>

<p>Soon I’ll be posting the second part with a tutorial.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>When developing, we often come across code we’ve seen hundreds of times that we
just copy and paste from project to project. Sometimes it’s so banal that it’s
not worth trying to improve, change or even modularize it. Ctrl-C + Ctrl-V may
be the cheapest and fastest solution, ergo, the best.</p>

<p>This is the kind of situation we see when masks must be applied to <em>text fields</em>
such as Social Security Numbers (SSN), Telephones, Zip Codes, and so on. Those
awful few dozens of lines we copy from one <code>textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString:</code>
to the other. It never changes because it works. There’s no need to improve it.
It’s always the same. But I’ve got tired of it. That nasty code that, in a well
structured class, can be as a mole in a beautiful woman’s face.</p>

<p>A few days ago I got some spare time and I started working on something I though
could come handy. So how do you simplify and generalise this problem that every
developer has to face at least once? Easy! <em>Regex</em>! Wait.. You sure it’s easy? I’ll
tell you, it wasn’t easy, but we’re talking about patterns in varying occasions
and, as I visualised it, <em>regex</em> is the best, simplest and most “approachable”
solution. I mean, everybody knows a little bit of <em>regex</em>.</p>

<p>While modelling, I wanted to make it as simple and as clean as possible, therefore,
for now, there are only two classes, and only one method you’ll really use, but
you can read the <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/">complete documentation</a>.
From now on, I’ll present a superficial approach to introduce this small library.</p>

<p>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/NSStringMask">Github Repo</a>!</p>

<h2 id="nsstringmask">NSStringMask</h2>

<p>The NSStringMask is the main class responsible for applying your masks to the
NSStrings. Among it’s methods the only noteworthy is
<a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/Classes/NSStringMask.html#//api/name/maskString:withPattern:placeholder:"><code>[NSStringMask maskString:withPattern:placeholder:]</code></a>.</p>

<p>It formats the given <code>string</code> based on the <code>pattern</code> you provide, filling the
voids with the <code>placeholder</code>. It automatically creates an instance of
NSRegularExpression with the option <code>CaseInsensitive</code>, so if you need a different
option, you may use the alternate method which expects a <em>regex</em> instead of <code>pattern</code>.</p>

<p>There’s also an alternative method that receives no <code>placeholder</code> (same as <code>nil</code>),
in this case, when the given <code>string</code> is shorter than expected, instead of
applying the mask, the method will return a cleaned <em>string</em> having only the
valid characters based on <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/Classes/NSStringMask.html#//api/name/validCharactersForString:"><code>validCharactersForString:</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="important-note">Important Note</h3>

<p>Doesn’t matter if providing a <code>pattern</code> or an instance of <em>regex</em>, the regular
expression <strong>must</strong> have capturing groups (parentheses). This is because the
class understands that everything that is not within parentheses is part of the
mask and must be interpreted as literal characters!</p>

<p>Suppose you’re formatting a SSN, whose <em>regex</em> pattern is <code>\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{3}</code>.
If you provide that <em>regex</em>/pattern, nothing will be formatted because the class
will think that <code>\d{3}</code> is part of the mask, and not 3 numbers that should go there.</p>

<p>The correct usage is: <code>(\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{3})</code></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span class="c1">// RIGHT:</span>
<span class="bp">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="nl">maskString</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;12345678&quot;</span> <span class="nl">withPattern</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;(\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{3})&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="c1">// result = @&quot;123-45-678&quot;</span>

<span class="c1">// WRONG:</span>
<span class="bp">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="nl">maskString</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;12345678&quot;</span> <span class="nl">withPattern</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{3}&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="c1">// result = nil</span></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Obs</strong>: If Xcode is showing a <em>warning</em> about unknown escape sequences, try
adding double slashes (<code>\\d</code>)</p>

<h2 id="uitextfieldmask">UITextFieldMask</h2>

<p>This is a subclass of UITextField, so you can set your <em>nibs</em> to use this class
and automatically apply masks to your <em>text fields</em>.</p>

<p>Obviously, you must provide a mask to transform your <em>strings</em>, and it’s
recommended that you do so when initialising your <em>view</em> or <em>view controller</em>.
So you should set the text field’s mask inside <code>viewDidLoad</code> or <code>awakeFromNib</code>.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a <em>view</em> with an <em>outlet</em> to an UITextFieldMask named <code>textFieldMask</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span class="p">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">awakeFromNib</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">mask</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="nl">maskWithPattern</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;(\d+)&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>

    <span class="n">textFieldMask</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">mask</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mask</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">textFieldMask</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">delegate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>A question for you: what does that mask accepts?</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>You can install it from <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/NSStringMask">Cocoa Pods</a>,
or clone the project from the <a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/NSStringMask">Github Repo</a>
and copy the files in the folder <code>Classes</code>.</p>

<h3 id="helpful-stuff">Helpful stuff</h3>

<p>I’ve also created <a href="https://gist.github.com/fjcaetano/5600452">this gist</a> with
some common patterns. Feel free to improve it!</p>

<div><script src="https://gist.github.com/5600452.js"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>These are a few patterns commonly used.

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>Tired of having to find out where an exception occurred, that was only captured
in the <em>main()</em>? Now I’m going to show you the best Xcode tip that no one talks
about. Don’t ask me why.</p>

<p>These are the very few steps that will save your life and make your day better.</p>

<h2 id="creating-an-exception-breakpoint">Creating an “Exception Breakpoint”</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to access the Breakpoint Navigator, which is the little
breakpoint marker on the top of your Project Navigator. If you didn’t know, the
Breakpoint Navigator show all your breakpoints in your project, where you can
easily manage them. (Click on the image to see it bigger)</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-1.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-1.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-1" /></a></p>

<p>Now that you’re in the Breakpoint Navigator, click on the little “+” button on
the bottom left of the screen. A little dialog window will show up and choose the
“Add Exception Breakpoint…” option.</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-3.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-3.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-3" /></a></p>

<p>Then, the Xcode will ask you some information about the breakpoint you’re creating:</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-4.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-4.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-4" /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Exception: There are three options: “All” to get all types of exceptions; “C++” to get only C++ exceptions; and “Objective-C” to get only ObjC exceptions. I like to leave it as “All”.</li>
  <li>Break: Leave it as “On Throw”. This way, the execution will stop when your code throws an exception and not when it catches, which is the default on <em>main()</em>.</li>
  <li>Action: You can set some action to be performed when the breakpoint is reached like run an Apple Script, shell command and others. I’ve never used it.</li>
  <li>Options: if you check this option, your code won’t stop when the breakpoint hits, making it useless. So leave it unchecked.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully created an Exception Breakpoint that will
stop whenever something odd happens! Let’s try it out!</p>

<p>As an example I’ve created an empty array and tried to access the object at index
0, which doesn’t exists. This is what happened:</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-5.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-5.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-5" /></a></p>

<p>Whoa! The Xcode stopped precisely where the problem was! Quite awesome, huh? But,
sometimes, it’s not that easy to visualise what the problem really is, so if
that’s happening to you, just hit “<em>play</em>”, and the code will keep executing as
if your breakpoint doesn’t exists. What happens now, is the <em>main()</em> catching
whatever exceptions that may happen.</p>

<p>So you can look at the console to see what the problem was:</p>

<p><a href="/images/best-xcode-hint-6.png"><img src="/images/best-xcode-hint-6.png" alt="best-xcode-hint-6" /></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>”-[__NSArrayI objectAtIndex:]: index 0 beyond bounds for empty array”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ta daa! I know it’s not perfect. It won’t get any <em>signals</em> (SIGABRT, SIGTRAP),
<em>flags</em> or <em>bad access</em> kinds of witchcraft, but I think it’s super helpful and
I think you guys should know.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>SQLite sucks. I think everybody knows, but I had to say it. But, sometimes, we
have no choice other than using it. Even though it’s horrible and we know we`ll
be frustrated, once in a lifetime, SQLite may be the best choice. Wether developing
a program with a tiny or fast persistence. Sure there are other alternatives that
may suit you best, but the platform we’re using may not support it.</p>

<p>For instance, I’m currently working on an iPad app that will have a fairly big
amount of data which must be available offline and it will have to be updated
sometimes. The best solution we came with is a background server task wich will
build an SQLite database populated with the most recent data and, when the user
requests, the iPad will download the whole database, overwriting any existing ones.</p>

<p>I’m no DBA, but I don’t think anyone writes database creation scripts anymore.
At least not for the usual <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, etc. I’m mostly a MySQL guy and, for
a long time, I’ve been using <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a>
to create my DB models and syncing with my existing database. It automatically
creates everything that needs to be created and alter all tables that must be
altered without losing any data (most of the time). It’s pretty good and I never
had any problems with it.</p>

<p>Now, back to listing reasons why SQLite sucks (dude, you can’t add a constraint
when altering a table!). As any platform/framework with no “official” team, SQLite
depends on the community to increase it’s awesomeness. Therefore, as everybody
knows SQLite <em>is not awesome</em>, no one really waste time developing a <em>good</em>
administration tool for it. What may happen, is a company own a DB management
program (such as <a href="http://www.navicat.com/">Navicat</a>) and something like this goes by:</p>

<pre><code>- Hey, we're supporting MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Cassandra, NoSQL and Postgree,
don't you think people will notice we're ignoring SQLite?

- God dammit *gasps*, add support to it too... but don't lose too much time with it!
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, there are no really good tools to work with SQLite available.
“Hey, what about <a href="http://www.navicat.com/">Navicat</a>?” It’s okay, but I found tons
of bugs in the Mac version. If that’s not enough, are you really willing to pay
to use a management tool for a free, open source database? But if you search deep
enough - like the 3rd page of Google - there are also some weird stuff that
appears such as <a href="http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/">SQLiteStudio</a> (for Mac). When I see
things I like that I think “why the hell would people lose time developing
something for SQLite?” But hey, there are weirdos for everything, so I’d like to
thank for the <a href="http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/">SQLiteStudio</a> team for being strange
enough to create it.</p>

<p>Even though it’s not the best tool ever, <a href="http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/">SQLiteStudio</a>
sure comes in handy and helps a lot, but it doesn’t solve the mentioned problem
of modelling your SQLite database and not dealing with SQL scripts. So, searching
for something that would fill this void I found <a href="http://www.henlich.de/software/sqlite-export-plugin-for-mysql-workbench/">this excellent script</a>
in Lua for <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> that
<em>automagically</em> generates the SQLite CREATE script from a model. It’s super easy
to install and use. Just follow this steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the .lua script (duh!)</li>
  <li>Click in the “Scripting” menu in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a>.</li>
  <li>Click “Install Plugin/Module”.</li>
  <li>Choose the downloaded .lua script.</li>
  <li>???</li>
  <li>Profit.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Now, if you want to try, open a model, click the “Plugins” menu and
under “Utilities” there must be an option named “Export SQLite CREATE Script”
which may be the first one. Just click it and choose where to save the .sql script
and execute it. <em>Voilà</em>! If you have any problems executing the generated script,
you may need to comment the <code>BEGIN;</code> at the top and the <code>COMMIT;</code> at the bottom
of the .sql script.</p>

<p>Super easy, isn’t it? Give it a try. Even if, like me, you hate SQLite. The plugin
solves the modelling problem, but creates a new one, because you can’t <code>ALTER</code> an
existing table since it only generates the <code>CREATE</code> script. But if that’s not a
problem go for it and be happy. When I found it, life suddenly became joyful again.</p>

    </h1>
  
</header>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>“Once upon a time, there was a tiny invisible force named <em>Luck</em>. Everybody loved
it and gave it gifts, hoping that, when needed, <em>Luck</em> would come for them. But
<em>Luck</em> had a younger sibling called <em>Bad Luck</em>, who hated <em>Luck</em> with all it’s
strength and always tried to be the opposite of <em>Luck</em>, because, while everybody
smiled and cheered for <em>Luck</em>, no one liked when <em>Bad Luck</em> was around. People
twisted their noses at <em>Bad Luck</em> and everybody blamed it for every bad thing that
happened in their lives.”</p>

<p>This is that time of year when joy and happiness take over people. Some folks are
going on vacations and we won’t see again for a while, and every single one of
them, without exception, while saying goodbye, wish “happy holidays, and good
luck!” If there’s one thing I can’t understand is this misconception people have
on <em>luck</em> and <em>bad luck</em>. I see all those people on new year’s eve wearing white,
jumping waves, and doing all kinds of foolishness hoping it “will bring them good
luck” and I can’t understand.</p>

<p>Luck isn’t something you can “force” or hope to come. “Luck” is the name we give
for a chain of events that, coincidentally, affect you in a good (<em>luckily</em>) or
bad (<em>unluckily</em>) way. Let’s picture an hypothetical scenario: you’re riding a
bike and, right before you cross another street, you hit a pedestrian. Was bad
luck that put that asshole there, right? Now, what if, one second after you hit
him, a car goes by at 60mph crossing the street you are at. Not so bad luck hitting
that good citizen now, huh? So, although the result is the same, the denomination
we give to that chain of events changed because of one single variable: some
douchebag driving his car while talking on the phone. So, what was bad luck for
you, became luck. But what about for that poor guy you hit? For him, independently
of the result, he’s still pretty banged up, so he <em>had</em> bad luck. It didn’t
randomly pointed at him and said “you, sir, are gonna get screwed!” It did just
happened. Bad Luck. When you do something that goes badly and you knew the odds
were against you, that’s not bad luck. It’s not the universe flipping you the
finger and screaming “fuck you, Jimmywobble!” That’s stupidity. <em>YOLO</em> my ass!</p>

<p>I not always wear white on new year’s eve, but when I do, it’s not because I think
it will bring me peace in the upcoming year. It’s because I want to get into the
spirit of the party. Those thousands of people in white, happy, drunk and with
the promise of better things to come are what drive me to join them and put on a
white shirt.</p>

<p>But don’t think I’m crazy just yet. If I’m walking down the street and I see a
ladder landing on a wall, of course I’ll pass around it. Not only I do not want
anything to fall on my head, but hey, what if I’m wrong? Why would I bet against
it when I don’t know if it will get angry and come back to bite me in the ass?</p>

<p>So, in this year’s ending, I wish that every single little incident that happens
to you in 2013 may be chained to good fortune. I hope that slam you’ll give with
your pinky finger in your table helps you find that earring you’re looking for
for three years. Or that tongue bite you’ll have may lead you into meeting some
super hot nurse.</p>

<p>So I wish you well in the new year. I hope you all the best.</p>

<p>And good luck.</p>
