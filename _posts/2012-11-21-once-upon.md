Hi there, stranger.

If you found this blog, you're probably my friend or already know what I do for
a living. But anyways I'm a mobile app developer (I mean, iOS developer), Python
fan and Django explorer.

In this blog, which I'll try to update at least once a month, I'll primarily talk
about my approaches in some aspects of my developer life, but if I digress and
start talking about karting, movies, cooking or anything, please, bare with me 
for I'll eventually come back to topic -- or not. Those are some of my current
hobbies and, in the future, more wil come and some will be forgotten.

That's me. Oh, btw, my name is Flávio (duh!), I'm 22 brazilian and you can reach
me at [blog@flaviocaetano.com](mailto:blog@flaviocaetano.com).

These are some of my links you may find interesting:

- [Github Profile](https://github.com/fjcaetano)
- [Personal Page](http://flaviocaetano.com)
- [LinkedIn Profile]({{ site.linkedin_profile }})

That's it for now. Soon will finish the next article I'm currently working on
and, when I'm satisfied -- which will probably be never, but I'll post it anyway
-- we'll talk more.

See you next time.
