  <h2><a href="/post/you-shouldnt-use-git-blame/">You Shouldn't Use Git Blame to Blame on People</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><!--:en--></p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever used <em>git-blame</em> to blame on people? I have and I was wrong more often than I was right. When I wasn't the one blaming others, the fingers almost always pointed at me when something went wrong. The problem with "default" <em>git-blame</em> and Xcode's blame view is that it only shows the last person that committed the lines in question and, not necessarily, wrote them.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Here where I work we have some code guidelines that not always are followed. Annoying as I am, usually I'm the one who fixes what is not according. Therefore, my name comes up in Xcode's blame view more  often than others.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">If you really need to find out whoever wrote that dreadful condition that crashes your app, use the <em>git-blame</em> command line with the "-n" option. It'll show the name of the person that first introduced that line and, quite probably, wrote it.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Or maybe, even better, get the changelog and the names of who touched a specific line of code with <em>git-log</em> "-L" option:</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/Screen-Shot-2014-07-23-at-5.31.32-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-941 alignnone" alt="git-log -L" src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/Screen-Shot-2014-07-23-at-5.31.32-PM-250x300.png" width="250" height="300" /></a></p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Thanks to: </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8435343/retrieve-the-commit-log-for-a-specific-line-in-a-file" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8435343/retrieve-the-commit-log-for-a-specific-line-in-a-file</a></p>

  <h2><a href="/post/this-is-when-a-cgfloat-may-be-a-double/">This is when a CGFloat may be a double</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">How would you explain the following code never getting into the <em>if</em> clause? Bear in mind I already knew it to be true at least once. I was an absolute true.</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">for (UIView *subview in view.subviews)
{
    CGFloat subviewAlpha = subview.alpha;
    CGFloat myAlpha = 0.15f;
    if (subviewAlpha == myAlpha &amp;&amp;
        [subview isKindOfClass:NSClassFromString(@&ldquo;_UIPopoverViewBackgroundComponentView&rdquo;)])
    {
        subview.alpha = 0.f;
    }
 }</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Printing the value also proved to be pointless:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSLog(@&ldquo;%f&rdquo;, subviewAlpha);
// output: 0.150000</p>

<p>NSLog(@&ldquo;%f&rdquo;, myAlpha);
// output: 0.150000</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, XCode&rsquo;s debugger shed a dim of light to the real issue. It showed that the true value of <em>subviewAlpha</em> is 0.14999999999999999, and as a floating point it&rsquo;s accurate. Meanwhile the value of <em>myAlpha</em> was 0.15000000596046448, so logically they are different. But what could be causing this singularity?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jumping to <em>CGFloat</em> definition, we can see that it may be an alias to float or double, depending on the system&rsquo;s architecture (x32 or x64). As I neglected to search, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGGeometry/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/CGFloat_Informational_Macros" target="_blank">Apple had it documented</a> and it could have saved me some time (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/gustavocsb/status/482602061352423424" target="_blank">@gustavocsb</a>, for the link).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/Screen-Shot-2014-06-28-at-12.53.35-AM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-781 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-28 at 12.53.35 AM" src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/Screen-Shot-2014-06-28-at-12.53.35-AM-300x130.png" width="300" height="130" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As usual, I solved it the more elegant way I could. &ldquo;Hey, if <em>CGFloat</em> is bipolar, let it tell me how to read it!&rdquo;</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">for (UIView *subview in view.subviews)
{
    if (subview.alpha == (CGFloat)0.15 &amp;&amp;
        [subview isKindOfClass:NSClassFromString(@&ldquo;_UIPopoverViewBackgroundComponentView&rdquo;)])
    {
        subview.alpha = 0.f;
    }
 }</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion, always have in mind that typings and comparisons  may not be as obvious as they seem. Be careful and, when in doubt, <em>typecast</em> it.</p></p>

  <h2><a href="/post/memoirs-of-a-wwdc-rookie/">Memoirs of a WWDC Rookie</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year I went to Apple&rsquo;s WWDC for the first time. I got the chance to be where every iOS developer wanted to be. The place where stuff happened. The place with the best among all. The place that mattered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We got to San Francisco the weekend before the conference and left the weekend after, so we had some time to explore a new city I didn&rsquo;t know. First of all, the food is great. I had the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/super-duper-burgers-san-francisco-3" target="_blank">best burger</a>, the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/r-and-g-lounge-san-francisco" target="_blank">best chinese</a> and the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-pizza-napoletana-san-francisco" target="_blank">best pizza</a> I&rsquo;ve ever had. And I&rsquo;m a foodie. Just Yelp it and be happy. There&rsquo;s a lot of tourism you can do in SF, some of the things we did were visiting Alcatraz, bike to Sausalito and drive to the Silicon Valley and visit the great tech companies HQs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Monday, when the WWDC starts, we got out of the hotel at 4:30am and got to the keynote line at around 4:45am and it was already huge. Honestly, I was skeptical about the keynote being all of what people say. But, as a first timer I thought I just had to go and see. We had bought beach chairs at Target in the Sunday and sat in the line and got to know new people, exchange ideas, do some networking. Despite the cold and sleepiness, the line itself was already worthy of the effort. But, thankfully, <strong>everything</strong> was worthy. Sure, some say we had the best keynote since the iPhone, but if you&rsquo;re a first timer, do find time and motivation to go to the keynote.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the WWDC, the sessions were outstanding. Me and my team split up to cover the maximum ground we could. Later we would get together to share what we learned and who we met. One thing I regret is not going to more labs. I was too focused on the sessions and lost this opportunity. Have this in mind: the sessions are streamed. Everyone can see it and you don&rsquo;t have to be at the WWDC to keep up to it. Tête-à-tête with Apple engineers is a one-of-a-kind experience. You can only do it by being there. The Design Lab lines can get pretty overwhelming. There were already people waiting outside the Moscone at 7am and Apple&rsquo;s designers insight of your app is priceless. This is my main advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prioritise people time rather than session time. Don&rsquo;t interrupt a conversation to go to a session. Sessions must be you&rsquo;re last resource. If you have nothing to do, go see one.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s easy to see great faces there. Tim Cook wandered about, Craig Federighi took selfies with whoever asked him, Steve Streza and his green hair was everywhere, Marco Arment, John Gruber, Aaron Hillegass and his cowboy hat&hellip; if you see someone you admire, go and talk to them. Lose your shyness. They are mostly great people and will be happy to talk to you and give you advice. There were also outstanding folks at the AltConf. Great talkers like Matt Thompson and Orta Therox that only attended to the AltConf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Go to parties and get togethers. Get to know people. Lot&rsquo;s of companies promote after parties at their HQs. Twitter, Github, Foursquare, Pinterest, Yelp, Dropbox, Pebble, Square&hellip; these are just some of the <a href="https://github.com/orta/wwdc_parties_2014" target="_blank">after parties</a>. Worst case scenario, you get to eat and drink for free and get to know their office.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, my advice is the same my mom gave to me over and over: go outside and talk to people.</p></p>

  <h2><a href="/post/swift-for-dummies/">Swift for Dummies</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">At WWDC 14, Apple introduced its new programming language: Swift. Nobody knows for sure what will happen to Objective-C, but one can only guess it won&rsquo;t be around for long. My guess is that Apple will be accepting ObjC apps up till iOS 10, but that is just my guest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By attending to the WWDC I had the opportunity of directly contacting Apple&rsquo;s engineers and insights most of people couldn&rsquo;t, so in the next posts I&rsquo;ll cover the basics of Swift.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re new to iOS or an experienced programmer. Now, we&rsquo;re all in the same boat. We all have to learn Swift from scratch, so forget everything you know about Objective-C and get ready to learn this brand new language. By the way, its potential is overwhelming.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The basics</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as I could tell, Swift borrows concepts from Python, Javascript and even Java. It&rsquo;s syntax also resembles these languages very much.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can forget about pointers for now, most of what we&rsquo;ll be using in Swift is passed through references. No more asterisk (woohoo \o/).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Swift plays with the concepts of variables and constants. There&rsquo;s no type definition to neither of those just the declares var, for variables, and <em>let</em>, for constants. As you may have figured out, constants can&rsquo;t be altered. We&rsquo;ll cover when to use it in a few steps.</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">var foo = &ldquo;this is getting good&rdquo;</p>

<p>let x = 42</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yep, there are no semi-colons at the end of statements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Switches are extremely powerful. <em>Cases</em> can be variables, strings, even a range of numbers. Also, cases don&rsquo;t automatically fall through the next condition, so there&rsquo;s no need to <em>break</em>.</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">switch myvar {
    case 4:
        // do something</p>

<pre><code>case someOtherVar:
    // this is getting wild

case "string":
    // holy cow!

case 1..4:
    // ok, this is awesome
default:
    // something unimplemented
</code></pre>

<p>}</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&rsquo;s also no need for surrounding parenthesis when working with conditions, unless it&rsquo;s a complex condition, as usual. Switches in Swift (yep, try saying that three times) are exhaustive. That means that you must either supply <em>cases</em> for every possible condition or a <em>default</em> to handle everything else. XCode will error at compile time if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final topic of this post is how you&rsquo;ll print output to the console. It&rsquo;s as simple as calling <em>println()</em> (it&rsquo;s a function) and you&rsquo;re done. Formatting strings is also awsome:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">var name = &ldquo;Flavio&rdquo;</p>

<p>println(&ldquo;Hello (name)!&rdquo;)
// Hello Flavio!</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is enough to get started and get familiar with Swift. Go ahead, poke it around, but don&rsquo;t try to get fancy just yet. I&rsquo;ll be covering more in the next few days.</p></p>

  <h2><a href="/post/cocoapods-and-resource_bundles/">Cocoapods and resource_bundles</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone that have recently developed any pods for Cocoapods know that resources should be gathered using the <a href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#resource_bundles" target="_blank"><code>resource_bundles</code></a> option. What is quite hard to figure out is how, exactly, to access those resources once they&rsquo;re set up in the <em>bundle</em>. It seems obvious now that I got it working, but I struggle a lot since there wasn&rsquo;t anything in Stackoverflow or anywhere else that provided the answer I came up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After setting up the <code>resource_bundles</code>, Cocoapods copies the resources found in a &ldquo;resources&rdquo; folder within the Pods project, but none of them are added in the target&rsquo;s &ldquo;Copy bundle resources&rdquo;. For that reason, I couldn&rsquo;t access any of the Pod&rsquo;s images or <em>xibs</em> in my project. Every time XCode threw me this error:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><code>&lsquo;Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException&rsquo;, reason: &lsquo;Could not load NIB in bundle:&lt;{PATH_TO_APP}> (loaded)&rsquo; with name '{VIEW_CONTROLLER_NAME}&lsquo;</code></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The obvious solution that wasn&rsquo;t listed anywhere is using the Cocoapods generated bundle (which the folder actually doesn&rsquo;t exist) as a <code>NSBundle</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSString *bundlePath             = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@&ldquo;MyBundle&rdquo; ofType:@&ldquo;bundle&rdquo;];</p>

<p>NSBundle *bundle                 = [NSBundle bundleWithPath:bundlePath];</p>

<p>MyViewController *viewController = [[MyViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@&ldquo;MyViewController&rdquo; bundle:bundle];</p>

<p>[self.navigationController pushViewController:viewController animated:YES];</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it&rsquo;s that simple, that obvious, though it&rsquo;s not listed anywhere. I believe to be prudent and convenient to write about it in order to help anyone who encounter themselves in the same situation as I did.</p>

  <h2><a href="/post/autolayout-is-hell-on-earth/">Autolayout Is Hell on Earth</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that every iOS developer is already aware of Apple&rsquo;s new directive forbidding any <em>apps</em> using <em>frame</em> to be submitted to the Appstore when the new iOS 7 goes public. That means that ALL new <em>app</em> will have be developed using this tool created by the son of a devil called <em>autolayout</em>.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone that has already used <em>autolayout</em> knows that margin, width, height and other properties are calculated in runtime, therefore, they consume sometimes unnecessary CPU time. For some inescrutable reason, Apple decided to create this new concept from scratch to ease working with different sized screens, while they could easily reuse existing CSS concepts like <em>margin</em>, <em>padding</em>, among others. In addition to being extremely confusing (a <code>UIView&rsquo;s</code> margin <em>constraints</em> are in its <em>superview</em>), having a pitiful syntax (“V:|-(-5)-[view1]-(&gt;=10)-[view2]-(912837)-|”), <em>autolayout</em> also makes everything slow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Protip:</strong> if you&rsquo;re configuring your <em>coinstraints</em> via code, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> forget seting <code>self.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO</code> in your view. It took me a couple of coffee cups to realise this was the reason why my <em>constraints</em> weren&rsquo;t being executing along with <code>[self layoutIfNeeded]</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently had to work with a <code>UICollectionView</code> and the scroll was getting really laggy. Anytime a new cell was loaded, the framerate dropped. After spending a few hours trying to find the root of the problem with a couple of friends (we even considered the problem being the SDK's <code>dequeue</code> thanks to <em>Profiler</em>) some inspired insight hit us and we decided to disable <em>autolayout</em> on the <code>UICollectionViewCell&rsquo;s</code> xib and everything flowed like a beautiful stream under the morning sunlight of tropical woods. So let us analise what happened: Apple created a new concept, from the grounds, that theoretically would solve all problems when working with screens of different sizes, but this devilish concept is composed of runtime calculated values that ruin the <em>app&rsquo;s</em> smoothness. Yep, it gets hard to work happily&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This view that is the <code>UICollectionView&rsquo;s</code> cell will not have <em>autolayout</em>. Nobody knows what will happen when we submit the <em>app</em> to the Appstore and we sincerely hope that Apple doesn&rsquo;t mind this view that, although is not explicitly using <em>frames</em>, also is not configured to accept <em>autolayout</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m yet to find an iOS developer that has nothing to complain about this weird invention, but, as usual, Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;this is what we want, so deal with it&rdquo; policy doesn&rsquo;t give us any alternatives. Instead of easing developers' work, they&rsquo;re making our daily lives every more difficult while <del>Android scores another point</del> Apple is walking backwards.</p></p>

  <h2><a href="/post/cocoapod-badges/">Cocoapod Badges</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">In any kind of environment, visual marks ease and enhance the comprehension of information. Countless researches studied the best way to display data, which colors induce what emotions, the association of geometric shapes with pre-formed concepts. The fact is that a sign or plaque draws much more attention than plain text. After all, an image is worth a thousand words, therefore, an image sends a much more significant message than some written words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s one of the reasons many development tools have featured <em>badges</em> (or <em>shields)</em> to inform the status of an application/framework/library/<em>etcetera</em>. It&rsquo;s the case of <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/status-images/" target="_blank">Travis CI</a>, <a href="https://codeclimate.com/changelog/510d4fde56b102523a0004bf" target="_blank">Code Climate</a>, <a href="http://blog.tech-angels.com/post/43141047457/gemnasium-v3-aka-gemnasium" target="_blank">Gemnasium</a>, among others, all following <a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/shields" target="_blank">olivierlacan/shields</a>&lsquo; trend, available Github.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m an iOS developer and previously have worked with Python/Django (though I still fool around) and I&rsquo;ve always found very interesting this creative way of sharing the state of a service dynamically, but sadly, there were no solution to Python nor iOS featuring <em>badges</em> (except for Travis CI for tests). But, recently, appeared - out of nowhere - <a href="https://pypip.in/" target="_blank">pypip</a>'s <em>shields</em> for Python packages that allows the visualisation of the latest available version of a package on <a href="http://pypi.python.org" target="_blank">pypi</a> or how many downloads some <em>release </em>had<em>.</em> When I came aware if it I resented for taking so long for solution so simple and effective to come up (or at least for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> to discover it)&hellip; but it got over the top when I found out&hellip; or better, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not found out<em></em></span> a similar solution for <a href="http://cocoapods.org" target="_blank">Cocoapods</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m one of those who doesn&rsquo;t miss a chance to solve a problem and endeavour an opportunity. That&rsquo;s how the <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/cocoapod-badges/" target="_blank">Cocoapod Badges</a> project started. Since Cocoapods doesn&rsquo;t provide an API, any info on the number of <em>users/downloads</em>, nor any kind of useful data, it proved to be a challenge, and all I could use had to be what was at hand: the latest version of a <em>pod</em>. But even though, mistaken are those who thought it easy. As mentioned, there&rsquo;s no API!</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Cocoapod Badges <img class=" alignnone" title="NSStringMask 1.1.2" alt="NSStringMask 1.1.2" src="https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/NSStringMask/badge.png" width="120" height="18" /></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digging through Cocoapod&rsquo;s and <a href="http://cocoadocs.org" target="_blank">Cocoadocs</a>&rsquo; websites, I tried, first, to use the <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/documents.jsonp" target="_blank">documents.jsonp</a> file that I found in the <em>source</em> of the <em>pod</em>&rsquo;s documentation website, however, I soon gave up for realising that its update frequency is too high (above one hour). At last, I had to content with the unfortunate <code>/search?q=</code> requested when searching for a <em>pod</em> in Cocoapod&rsquo;s main page. At first, it looked like an excellent solution since it returned a <code>json</code> object with some info, until I realised that inside the object was a string with some <code>html</code> code and only inside that code was the <em>pod</em>&rsquo;s latest version. &ldquo;<em>God dammit!</em>&rdquo; Now I have to run a request on a &ldquo;pseudo-<em>webservice</em>&rdquo; and parse it with <code>XPATH</code> to get the latest version!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Super easy! But, as my mother would on a brazilian saying: &ldquo;<em>few shit is silliness</em>&rdquo;. The damned &ldquo;API&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t return the requested <em>pod</em>, but anything with the searched string. To get something more useful, I figured that <code>/search?q=name:POD_NAME</code> searches only in the <em>pod</em>&rsquo;s name and not in its description, what significantly reduces the results, specially when dealing with popular <em>pods</em> such as <a href="http://afnetworking.github.io/AFNetworking/index.html" target="_blank">AFNetworking</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After all that suffering, I finally got the information I wanted, but then, how do I show it in an image? Olivier Lacan&rsquo;s repo, that enabled all the existing <em>badges,</em> provides, beyond the <em>.png</em> to existing services, <code>.SVG</code> vectorial files that render <code>xml</code> data to images. So, accidentally, I double-clicked the <code>.SVG</code> file and the holy Google Chrome opened it as an image! Finally good news! As the information about the version is in plain text inside the <code>xml</code>, all I had to do was to set the <code>mimetype</code> so Django could provide the file as an image.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1 <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a> <em>dyno</em> later and the service is available fulltime (depending on Cocoapods website) through the images' url:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code><a href="http://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/$PODNAME/badge.png">http://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/$PODNAME/badge.png</a></code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All you have to do is replace the <code>$PODNAME</code> with the name of the pod you want. Simple and easy, isn&rsquo;t it? Use it at will! And suport the Github repo!</p></p>

  <h2><a href="/post/documentation-and-objective-c/">Documentation and Objective-C (part 1)</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an article I originally wrote for the brazilian online magazine <a href="http://www.devmedia.com.br/aprenda-a-documentar-seus-projetos-em-objective-c-revista-mobile-magazine-48/27964">DevMedia&rsquo;s Mobile Magazine</a>. This first part is the article&rsquo;s introduction, so seat back and relax. Soon I&rsquo;ll post the second - and final - part with a tutorial to the Apple like documentation generator <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;In the agile programming environment, using methodologies such as SCRUM, Agile and Lean, we can&rsquo;t always document our sources. After all, pragmatics as we developers are, why would we lose time if the documentation won&rsquo;t be compiled, won&rsquo;t do any difference in the code&rsquo;s performance and demands a considerable slice of our time? But despite all that, the lack of documentation hurts. A lot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Who&rsquo;s familiarised, knows that in the ultra accelerated rhythm of <em>startups</em>, where everything is at the top of the list, there&rsquo;s not always time to apply some of the good programming technics that aren&rsquo;t crucial to the sanity and speed of the code. Oftenly, there&rsquo;s no time to formally test classes and methods because of the virtually null due time that is given. It&rsquo;s easy to find developers awake all night in <em>hackatons</em> to successfully deliver <em>that key</em> feature that will make "the whole difference&rdquo;. Test? Document? Review? There&rsquo;s so much to do and so little time!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s the reality of many young developers who enter this ultra competitive environment searching for the dream of running their own companies. The responsibilty of satisfying potential investors, the pressure for deploys and the client&rsquo;s needs frequently obfuscate technics that improve development and maintenance experiences, but that are not considered primordial to the construction of an application. How often didn&rsquo;t I went back to an undocumented code done less than two months before and thought &ldquo;<em>what the flock does this loop do?</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>why, on earth, is this class here and not there?</em>&rdquo; Of course, when those lines of code were written, everything made perfect sense, but the moment those <em>ifs</em> and <em>fors</em> went out of the conscious mind, their meaning were long gone. After all, quoting the chinese saying: &ldquo;<em>the ink is better than memory</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So let us document. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt, doesn&rsquo;t make you fat and isn&rsquo;t illegal. Actually, documenting is like eating vegetables: no one really likes it, but we do it hopping that, in the end, it&rsquo;s worth the result. But unlike the vegetables, it&rsquo;s proved that documenting helps. Contrary to the common thought, the time spent documenting a day&rsquo;s work is reasonably irrelevant and the benefit in return is definitely worthy. With practice and experience, no more than 30 minutes can be lost documenting everything that was made in a whole day. That way, the developer stays focused in his activity and doesn&rsquo;t deviates doing other stuff that draws his attention or stand in his way of writing the best possible algorithm. Therefore, don&rsquo;t wait until the end of the week, when the work pile up, part of the features were already forgotten and we&rsquo;re all dying to that ice-cold friday-night-beer. Personally, I recommend documenting in the end of the day. In my case, it&rsquo;s always the last thing I do before leaving, because everything is still fresh in memory and the amount of code produced in one day doesn&rsquo;t compare to what&rsquo;s done in one week. If that&rsquo;s not enough, I realised that I do a final unconscious revision before the final <em>commit</em> when I&rsquo;m passing by the code documenting it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A well documented code is good for everybody. What would be of us without the independent frameworks, packages and repositories used daily if they weren&rsquo;t documented, or even had a bad documentation? Even senior programmers, frequently, return to Apple&rsquo;s documentation to a better understanding of Cocoa&rsquo;s classes. Whether consulting a less used protocol, or lower level functions to manage <em>sockets</em>, <em>threads</em> or <em>semaphores</em>. Nobody can remember everything, so don&rsquo;t try it, you&rsquo;re not an elephant. It&rsquo;s not rare to find developers who use the documentation as a last resource to understanding some tool. This line of thought makes sense if we think that we want everything to be as explained as possible so we don&rsquo;t lose any time trying to interpretate any possible use, when trying to comprehend some feature. But we must never forget that even when visiting forums, asking more experienced developers or reading articles in blogs, EVERYTHING had a documentation as basis. Well, even this article wouldn&rsquo;t exist if wasn&rsquo;t for <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>&rsquo;s documentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Documenting - or at least commenting - source codes is fundamental to the intelligibility of the code. Implementing these technics with developers that never done it, oftenly is seen with prejudice and suspicion that are common to the staunch and stubborn nature of young programmers. I must confess that I didn&rsquo;t wanted to document when people first told me to. Moreover, because of it&rsquo;s so unusual syntax, it&rsquo;s interesting to verbalize what&rsquo;s developed in ObjC to ease it&rsquo;s lecture, specially by more unexperienced programmers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As time goes by, with the expansion of the <em>startup</em>, the pressure and need of code documentation is felt. Contrary to many programming languages - such as Java with it&rsquo;s hideous GUI Javadoc - Objective-C doesn&rsquo;t have an &ldquo;official&rdquo; documentation generator. In our <em>quest</em> to find a differentiated framework, which could make us feel as if we were really making difference, we found the excellent <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a> that, using code comments <em>à la</em> Javadoc, generates Apple like documentation, with a docset <em>automagically</em> installed in XCode, static HTML sources which can be uploaded to a cloud (<em>vide</em> <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/1.1.2/">NSStringMask</a> which uses <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>) and an interface identical to Cocoa&rsquo;s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>&rsquo;s already described advantages, are also the documentation parsing through code comments, wich allow the developer to consult the documentation without the need of opening a new window, since everything is in the code. The integration with XCode allows the visualisation of tooltips with quick access to the documentation by simply holding the <em>Option</em> key and clicking a method or class. Moreover, by &ldquo;compiling&rdquo; <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a> in your documented project, the library&rsquo;s docset is already imported to your <em>Organizer</em>. Simple or not? But, undoubtedly, <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>&rsquo;s main advantage is it&rsquo;s interface that&rsquo;s identical to Apple&rsquo;s documentation. I think it&rsquo;s very unlikely that there&rsquo;s any ObjC developer that has never read Cocoa&rsquo;s documentation, be the one embedded on XCode or the on in Apples developers portal. By reusing the known model, it terminates the problem of having to familiarise to a new layout.&ldquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soon I&rsquo;ll be posting the second part with a tutorial.</p>

  <h2><a href="/post/nsstringmask/">NSStringMask: Simplifying masks</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When developing, we often come across code we&rsquo;ve seen hundreds of times that we just copy and paste from project to project. Sometimes it&rsquo;s so banal that it&rsquo;s not worth trying to improve, change or even modularize it. Ctrl-C + Ctrl-V may be the cheapest and fastest solution, ergo, the best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the kind of situation we see when masks must be applied to <em>text fields</em> such as Social Security Numbers (SSN), Telephones, Zip Codes, and so on. Those awful few dozens of lines we copy from one <code>textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString:</code> to the other. It never changes because it works. There&rsquo;s no need to improve it. It&rsquo;s always the same. But I&rsquo;ve got tired of it. That nasty code that, in a well structured class, can be as a mole in a beautiful woman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few days ago I got some spare time and I started working on something I though could come handy. So how do you simplify and generalise this problem that every developer has to face at least once? Easy! <em>Regex</em>! Wait.. You sure it&rsquo;s easy? I&rsquo;ll tell you, it wasn&rsquo;t easy, but we&rsquo;re talking about patterns in varying occasions and, as I visualised it, <em>regex</em> is the best, simplest and most &ldquo;approachable&rdquo; solution. I mean, everybody knows a little bit of <em>regex</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While modelling, I wanted to make it as simple and as clean as possible, therefore, for now, there are only two classes, and only one method you&rsquo;ll really use, but you can read the <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/">complete documentation</a>. From now on, I&rsquo;ll present a superficial approach to introduce this small library.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fork the <a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/NSStringMask">Github Repo</a>!</p>
<h2 id="nsstringmask" style="text-align: justify;">NSStringMask</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The NSStringMask is the main class responsible for applying your masks to the NSStrings. Among it&rsquo;s methods the only noteworthy is <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/Classes/NSStringMask.html#//api/name/maskString:withPattern:placeholder:"><code>[NSStringMask maskString:withPattern:placeholder:]</code></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It formats the given <code>string</code> based on the <code>pattern</code> you provide, filling the voids with the <code>placeholder</code>. It automatically creates an instance of NSRegularExpression with the option <code>CaseInsensitive</code>, so if you need a different option, you may use the alternate method which expects a <em>regex</em> instead of <code>pattern</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&rsquo;s also an alternative method that receives no <code>placeholder</code> (same as <code>nil</code>), in this case, when the given <code>string</code> is shorter than expected, instead of applying the mask, the method will return a cleaned <em>string</em> having only the valid characters based on <a href="http://fjcaetano.github.io/NSStringMask/Classes/NSStringMask.html#//api/name/validCharactersForString:"><code>validCharactersForString:</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="important-note" style="text-align: justify;">Important Note</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doesn&rsquo;t matter if providing a <code>pattern</code> or an instance of <em>regex</em>, the regular expression <strong>must</strong> have capturing groups (parentheses). This is because the class understands that everything that is not within parentheses is part of the mask and must be interpreted as literal characters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suppose you&rsquo;re formatting a SSN, whose <em>regex</em> pattern is <code>\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{3}</code>. If you provide that <em>regex</em>/pattern, nothing will be formatted because the class will think that <code>\d{3}</code> is part of the mask, and not 3 numbers that should go there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The correct usage is: <code>(\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{3})</code></p>
<div class="codehilite" style="text-align: justify;">
<pre><span class="c1">// RIGHT:</span>
<span class="n">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="nl">maskString:</span><span class="s">@&ldquo;12345678&rdquo;</span> <span class="nl">withPattern:</span><span class="s">@&ldquo;(\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{3})&rdquo;</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="c1">// result = @&ldquo;123-45-678&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="c1">// WRONG:</span>
<span class="n">NSString</span> <span class="o"><em></span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="nl">maskString:</span><span class="s">@&ldquo;12345678&rdquo;</span> <span class="nl">withPattern:</span><span class="s">@&ldquo;\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{3}&rdquo;</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="c1">// result = nil</span></pre>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Obs</strong>: If Xcode is showing a <em>warning</em> about unknown escape sequences, try adding double slashes (<code>\d</code>)</p>
<h2 id="uitextfieldmask" style="text-align: justify;">UITextFieldMask</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a subclass of UITextField, so you can set your <em>nibs</em> to use this class and automatically apply masks to your <em>text fields</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, you must provide a mask to transform your <em>strings</em>, and it&rsquo;s recommended that you do so when initialising your <em>view</em> or <em>view controller</em>. So you should set the text field&rsquo;s mask inside <code>viewDidLoad</code> or <code>awakeFromNib</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suppose you have a <em>view</em> with an <em>outlet</em> to an UITextFieldMask named <code>textFieldMask</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite" style="text-align: justify;">
<pre><span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">awakeFromNib</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="o"></em></span><span class="n">mask</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSStringMask</span> <span class="nl">maskWithPattern:</span><span class="s">@&ldquo;(</span><span class="se">\</span><span class="s">d+)&rdquo;</span><span class="p">];</span></p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="n"&gt;textFieldMask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;textFieldMask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><span class="p">}</span></pre>
</div>

  <h2><a href="/post/best-xcode-tip/">The Best XCode Tip No One Ever Gave You</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tired of having to find out where an exception occurred, that was only captured in the <em>main()</em>? Now I&rsquo;m going to show you the best Xcode tip that no one talks about. Don&rsquo;t ask me why.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are the very few steps that will save your life and make your day better.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-exception-breakpoint" style="text-align: justify;">Creating an &ldquo;Exception Breakpoint&rdquo;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first thing to do is to access the Breakpoint Navigator, which is the little breakpoint marker on the top of your Project Navigator. If you didn&rsquo;t know, the Breakpoint Navigator show all your breakpoints in your project, where you can easily manage them. (Click on the image to see it bigger)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69" alt="best-xcode-hint-1" src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-1.png"  /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that you&rsquo;re in the Breakpoint Navigator, click on the little &ldquo;+&rdquo; button on the bottom left of the screen. A little dialog window will show up and choose the &ldquo;Add Exception Breakpoint…&rdquo; option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71" alt="best-xcode-hint-3" src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-3.png" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, the Xcode will ask you some information about the breakpoint you&rsquo;re creating:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-4.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-72" alt="best-xcode-hint-4" src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-4.png" /></a></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Exception: There are three options: &ldquo;All&rdquo; to get all types of exceptions; &ldquo;C++&rdquo; to get only C++ exceptions; and &ldquo;Objective-C&rdquo; to get only ObjC exceptions. I like to leave it as &ldquo;All&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Break: Leave it as &ldquo;On Throw&rdquo;. This way, the execution will stop when your code throws an exception and not when it catches, which is the default on <em>main()</em>.</li>
<li>Action: You can set some action to be performed when the breakpoint is reached like run an Apple Script, shell command and others. I&rsquo;ve never used it.</li>
<li>Options: if you check this option, your code won&rsquo;t stop when the breakpoint hits, making it useless. So leave it unchecked.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Congratulations! You&rsquo;ve successfully created an Exception Breakpoint that will stop whenever something odd happens! Let&rsquo;s try it out!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an example I&rsquo;ve created an empty array and tried to access the object at index 0, which doesn&rsquo;t exists. This is what happened:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-5.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-73" alt="best-xcode-hint-5" src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-5.png" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whoa! The Xcode stopped precisely where the problem was! Quite awesome, huh? But, sometimes, it&rsquo;s not that easy to visualise what the problem really is, so if that&rsquo;s happening to you, just hit &ldquo;<em>play</em>&rdquo;, and the code will keep executing as if your breakpoint doesn&rsquo;t exists. What happens now, is the <em>main()</em> catching whatever exceptions that may happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So you can look at the console to see what the problem was:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-6.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-74" alt="best-xcode-hint-6" src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/best-xcode-hint-6.png" /></a></p>
<div class="codehilite" style="text-align: justify;">
<pre>&ldquo;<span class="o">-</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">__NSArrayI</span> <span class="n">objectAtIndex</span><span class="p">:]:</span> <span class="n">index</span> 0 <span class="n">beyond</span> <span class="n">bounds</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">empty</span> <span class="n">array</span>&rdquo;</pre>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ta daa! I know it&rsquo;s not perfect. It won&rsquo;t get any <em>signals</em> (SIGABRT, SIGTRAP), <em>flags</em> or <em>bad access</em> kinds of witchcraft, but I think it&rsquo;s super helpful and I think you guys should know.</p></p>

  <h2><a href="/post/sqlite-modelling/">SQLite Modelling</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SQLite sucks. I think everybody knows, but I had to say it. But, sometimes, we have no choice other than using it. Even though it&rsquo;s horrible and we know we`ll be frustrated, once in a lifetime, SQLite may be the best choice. Wether developing a program with a tiny or fast persistence. Sure there are other alternatives that may suit you best, but the platform we&rsquo;re using may not support it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, I&rsquo;m currently working on an iPad app that will have a fairly big amount of data which must be available offline and it will have to be updated sometimes. The best solution we came with is a background server task wich will build an SQLite database populated with the most recent data and, when the user requests, the iPad will download the whole database, overwriting any existing ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m no DBA, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone writes database creation scripts anymore. At least not for the usual <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, etc. I&rsquo;m mostly a MySQL guy and, for a long time, I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> to create my DB models and syncing with my existing database. It automatically creates everything that needs to be created and alter all tables that must be altered without losing any data (most of the time). It&rsquo;s pretty good and I never had any problems with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, back to listing reasons why SQLite sucks (dude, you can&rsquo;t add a constraint when altering a table!). As any platform/framework with no &ldquo;official&rdquo; team, SQLite depends on the community to increase it&rsquo;s awesomeness. Therefore, as everybody knows SQLite <em>is not awesome</em>, no one really waste time developing a <em>good</em> administration tool for it. What may happen, is a company own a DB management program (such as <a href="http://www.navicat.com/">Navicat</a>) and something like this goes by:</p>
<div class="codehilite" style="text-align: justify;">
<pre>    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">Hey</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">we</span><span class="o">&lsquo;</span><span class="n">re</span> <span class="n">supporting</span> <span class="n">MySQL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">SQL</span> <span class="n">Server</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">MongoDB</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Cassandra</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NoSQL</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="n">Postgree</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">don</span><span class="o">&rsquo;</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">you</span> <span class="n">think</span> <span class="n">people</span> <span class="n">will</span> <span class="n">notice</span> <span class="n">we</span><span class="o">&lsquo;</span><span class="n">re</span> <span class="n">ignoring</span> <span class="n">SQLite</span>?
    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">God</span> <span class="n">dammit</span> <span class="o"><em></span><span class="n">gasps</span><span class="o"></em></span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">add</span> <span class="n">support</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">too</span><span class="p">&hellip;</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">don</span><span class="o">&rsquo;</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">lose</span> <span class="n">too</span> <span class="n">much</span> <span class="n">time</span> <span class="n">with</span> <span class="n">it</span>!</pre>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, there are no really good tools to work with SQLite available. &ldquo;Hey, what about <a href="http://www.navicat.com/">Navicat</a>?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s okay, but I found tons of bugs in the Mac version. If that&rsquo;s not enough, are you really willing to pay to use a management tool for a free, open source database? But if you search deep enough - like the 3rd page of Google - there are also some weird stuff that appears such as <a href="http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/">SQLiteStudio</a> (for Mac). When I see things I like that I think &ldquo;why the hell would people lose time developing something for SQLite?&rdquo; But hey, there are weirdos for everything, so I&rsquo;d like to thank for the <a href="http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/">SQLiteStudio</a> team for being strange enough to create it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though it&rsquo;s not the best tool ever, <a href="http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/">SQLiteStudio</a> sure comes in handy and helps a lot, but it doesn&rsquo;t solve the mentioned problem of modelling your SQLite database and not dealing with SQL scripts. So, searching for something that would fill this void I found <a href="http://www.henlich.de/software/sqlite-export-plugin-for-mysql-workbench/">this excellent script</a> in Lua for <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> that automagically generates the SQLite CREATE script from a model. It&rsquo;s super easy to install and use. Just follow this steps:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Download the .lua script (duh!)</li>
<li>Click in the &ldquo;Scripting&rdquo; menu in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a>.</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Install Plugin/Module&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Choose the downloaded .lua script.</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s it. Now, if you want to try, open a model, click the &ldquo;Plugins&rdquo; menu and under &ldquo;Utilities&rdquo; there must be an option named &ldquo;Export SQLite CREATE Script&rdquo; which may be the first one. Just click it and choose where to save the .sql script and execute it. <em>Voilà</em>! If you have any problems executing the generated script, you may need to comment the <code>BEGIN;</code> at the top and the <code>COMMIT;</code> at the bottom of the .sql script.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Super easy, isn&rsquo;t it? Give it a try. Even if, like me, you hate SQLite. The plugin solves the modelling problem, but creates a new one, because you can&rsquo;t <code>ALTER</code> an existing table since it only generates the <code>CREATE</code> script. But if that&rsquo;s not a problem go for it and be happy. When I found it, life suddenly became joyful again.</p>

  <h2><a href="/post/the-tale-of-luck/">The Tale of Luck</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Once upon a time, there was a tiny invisible force named <em>Luck</em>. Everybody loved it and gave it gifts, hoping that, when needed, <em>Luck</em> would come for them. But <em>Luck</em> had a younger sibling called <em>Bad Luck</em>, who hated <em>Luck</em> with all it&rsquo;s strength and always tried to be the opposite of <em>Luck</em>, because, while everybody smiled and cheered for <em>Luck</em>, no one liked when <em>Bad Luck</em> was around. People twisted their noses at <em>Bad Luck</em> and everybody blamed it for every bad thing that happened in their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is that time of year when joy and happiness take over people. Some folks are going on vacations and we won&rsquo;t see again for a while, and every single one of them, without exception, while saying goodbye, wish &ldquo;happy holidays, and good luck!&rdquo; If there&rsquo;s one thing I can&rsquo;t understand is this misconception people have on <em>luck</em> and <em>bad luck</em>. I see all those people on new year&rsquo;s eve wearing white, jumping waves, and doing all kinds of foolishness hoping it &ldquo;will bring them good luck&rdquo; and I can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luck isn&rsquo;t something you can &ldquo;force&rdquo; or hope to come. &ldquo;Luck&rdquo; is the name we give for a chain of events that, coincidentally, affect you in a good (<em>luckily</em>) or bad (<em>unluckily</em>) way. Let&rsquo;s picture an hypothetical scenario: you&rsquo;re riding a bike and, right before you cross another street, you hit a pedestrian. Was bad luck that put that asshole there, right? Now, what if, one second after you hit him, a car goes by at 60mph crossing the street you are at. Not so bad luck hitting that good citizen now, huh? So, although the result is the same, the denomination we give to that chain of events changed because of one single variable: some douchebag driving his car while talking on the phone. So, what was bad luck for you, became luck. But what about for that poor guy you hit? For him, independently of the result, he&rsquo;s still pretty banged up, so he <em>had</em> bad luck. It didn&rsquo;t randomly pointed at him and said &ldquo;you, sir, are gonna get screwed!&rdquo; It did just happened. Bad Luck. When you do something that goes badly and you knew the odds were against you, that&rsquo;s not bad luck. It&rsquo;s not the universe flipping you the finger and screaming &ldquo;fuck you, Jimmywobble!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s stupidity. <em>YOLO</em> my ass!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I not always wear white on new year&rsquo;s eve, but when I do, it&rsquo;s not because I think it will bring me peace in the upcoming year. It&rsquo;s because I want to get into the spirit of the party. Those thousands of people in white, happy, drunk and with the promise of better things to come are what drive me to join them and put on a white shirt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m crazy just yet. If I&rsquo;m walking down the street and I see a ladder landing on a wall, of course I&rsquo;ll pass around it. Not only I do not want anything to fall on my head, but hey, what if I&rsquo;m wrong? Why would I bet against it when I don&rsquo;t know if it will get angry and come back to bite me in the ass?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, in this year&rsquo;s ending, I wish that every single little incident that happens to you in 2013 may be chained to good fortune. I hope that slam you&rsquo;ll give with your pinky finger in your table helps you find that earring you&rsquo;re looking for for three years. Or that tongue bite you&rsquo;ll have may lead you into meeting some super hot nurse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I wish you well in the new year. I hope you all the best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And good luck.</p>

  <h2><a href="/post/once-upon-2/">Once Upon a Time, There Was Nothing (part. 2)</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main reasons I like Django is it&rsquo;s awesome auto-generated admin interface. It&rsquo;s  just awesome. When you start to play with it and discover apps like <a href="https://bitbucket.org/izi/django-admin-tools/wiki/Home" target="_blank">django-admin-tools</a>, the faded <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-jqmobile/" target="_blank">jq-mobile</a> and other cool stuff you realise how versatile Django really is.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">The Context</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I started learning Django I created a small manager for some of my hobbies. The first one was a book manager in which I have a log of <strong>every single</strong> book I&rsquo;ve ever read, <strong>when</strong> I read it, <strong>where</strong> the book is located, if it's <strong>borrowed</strong> to somebody, a &ldquo;<strong>GIVE IT BACK TO ME</strong>&rdquo; button that sends an email with that exact message to whoever has it, and so on. Among everything, I also added a field for the book&rsquo;s <em>cover</em> but I never really used it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More recently, I restarted to improve my card deck collection (yes, I&rsquo;m weird) and added this new feature to my Django manager. But this time, since it&rsquo;s cataloging a collection and decks are mainly visual, the photos of the decks are <strong><em>very</em></strong> important. Yes, I said image<em><strong>S</strong></em>. Each deck has five photos:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The Front of the Box</li>
<li>The Back of the Box</li>
<li>The Back of the Cards</li>
<li>The Joker</li>
<li>The Ace of Spades</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are decks with a different back for each card, but that&rsquo;s not important,. Those are the options I&rsquo;m contemplating. But, since not all of them are opened (I have one numbered deck that goes to 2500 copies. I won&rsquo;t open it. Never!) only the first two images are requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, now that you are aware of the context, this is when the problem (and the fun) started.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Problem</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started looking for some Django solution that could easily show thumbnails for my images in my admin module. Guess what was my surprise when I realised there was <em>N</em><em>one</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was absolutely nothing that would do what wanted and needed. The closest things I found were the automatic thumbnail creator <a href="https://github.com/sorl/sorl-thumbnail" target="_blank">sorl-thumbnail</a> and <a href="http://www.acedevs.com/blog/2011/07/11/django-admin-list-view-thumbnails/" target="_blank">Ace Devs solution</a> which didn&rsquo;t solve my problem. Dude, my images have 1936x2592 pixels of resolution. I can&rsquo;t just show them as they are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s when I realised I would have to develop a new solution for that.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">The Solution (aka The Fun Part)</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m a modest guy, I don&rsquo;t like bragging about what I do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No forget it. Bullshit. I do like to show everyone what I did. Specially when I think it&rsquo;s awesome, I mean, It&rsquo;s awesome. Don&rsquo;t you like sharing awesome stuff with your friends? Dude, I&rsquo;m even writing an article about it! In <strong>TWO</strong> languages!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, what I did was basically to join and improve those two solutions I found. &ldquo;<strong>Basically</strong>&rdquo; because, in the deep, it was a little more complex than that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I came up with the stupidest yet simplest name I could find: <a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/django-admin-thumbnail" target="_blank">django-admin-thumbnail</a>. I know, it&rsquo;s über stupid. But it&rsquo;s also simple, so it works.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">django-admin-thumbnail</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The package automatically works on your <em>list_display</em> of your <em>ModelAdmin</em>. It <em>automagically</em> detects your <em>ImageFields</em>, converts it to thumbnail (physically allocated) using <a href="https://github.com/sorl/sorl-thumbnail" target="_blank">sorl-thumbnail</a> and displays to you in a user friendly way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is how it looks when you hover your cursor over an <em>ImageField</em> in your model grid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/thumb_image.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/thumb_image.png" width="538" height="331" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The image is in portuguese. Imagem = Image, Abrir Imagem = Open Image. <a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/django-admin-thumbnail" target="_blank">django-admin-thumbnail</a> is localizable but, currently, only <code>pt-BR</code> and <code>en-US</code> are the officially supported languages. If you want it to be in your language, just send me your <code>.po</code> file and I&rsquo;ll validate it and share. It&rsquo;s ridiculous, there are only two tags. Give it a try!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I finished, I realised how simple and effective it was. I had to share it with the community. So I took the opportunity to create my first <em>python package</em>. It was a pain in the ass because the documentation is lame, specially the <em>long-description</em> part. I had to generate it a zillion times to get the <em>reStructured Text</em> working until I found the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2html" target="_blank">py2html</a> command.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Wrap and Finish</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s it. If you want to know more about <a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano/django-admin-thumbnail" target="_blank">django-admin-thumbnail</a> just click the link and it will send you to the Github repository. There&rsquo;s a quick start guide. <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_admin_thumbnail/0.1.1" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s the link for the python package</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any trouble to use it, don&rsquo;t hesitate to send me a message.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have fun!</p></p>

  <h2><a href="/post/once-upon/">Once Upon a Time, There Was Nothing</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><p><!--:en-->
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi there, stranger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you found this blog, you&rsquo;re probably my friend or already know what I do for a living. But anyways I&rsquo;m a mobile app developer (I mean, iOS developer), Python fan and Django explorer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this blog, which I&rsquo;ll try to update at least once a month, I&rsquo;ll primarily talk about my approaches in some aspects of my developer life, but if I digress and start talking about karting, movies, cooking or anything, please, bare with me for I&rsquo;ll eventually come back to topic &ndash; or not. Those are some of my current hobbies and, in the future, more wil come and some will be forgotten.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s me. Oh, btw, my name is Flávio (duh!), I&rsquo;m 22 brazilian and you can reach me at <a href="mailto:flavio@vieiracaetano.com"><a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#102;&#108;&#97;&#118;&#x69;&#x6f;&#64;&#x76;&#x69;&#101;&#x69;&#114;&#97;&#99;&#x61;&#101;&#x74;&#97;&#110;&#111;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x66;&#x6c;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#x6f;&#64;&#x76;&#x69;&#101;&#x69;&#114;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#x65;&#x74;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a></a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s it for now. Soon will finish the next article I&rsquo;m currently working on and, when I&rsquo;m satisfied &ndash; which will probably be never, but I&rsquo;ll post it anyway &ndash; we&rsquo;ll talk more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you next time.</p></p>
