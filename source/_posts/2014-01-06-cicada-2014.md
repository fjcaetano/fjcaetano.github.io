This morning, Cicada 3301 went back to active! In his/hers [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/1231507051321)
used on last year's challenge there was new link to an image posted on imgur.

[![First Chapter](/images/zN4h51m.jpg)](/images/zN4h51m.jpg)

Reproducing the tradicional previous steps, by extracting the image using
[outguess](http://www.outguess.org/) we came onto a message, once again signed.
Its authenticity could be proved using Cicada's previous known
[public key](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;search=0x181F01E57A35090F).

Now let's get our hands dirty! The first task was easy, since it's steps were
already elucidated on previous years. Now things start to get interesting.

If you're interested in following the challenge progress, [Uncovering Cicada](http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE)
is on a good pace.

Good luck, and good hunting!
