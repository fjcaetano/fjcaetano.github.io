<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever used <em>git-blame</em> to blame on people? I have and I was wrong more often than I was right. When I wasn't the one blaming others, the fingers almost always pointed at me when something went wrong. The problem with "default" <em>git-blame</em> and Xcode's blame view is that it only shows the last person that committed the lines in question and, not necessarily, wrote them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here where I work we have some code guidelines that not always are followed. Annoying as I am, usually I'm the one who fixes what is not according. Therefore, my name comes up in Xcode's blame view more  often than others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you really need to find out whoever wrote that dreadful condition that crashes your app, use the <em>git-blame</em> command line with the "-n" option. It'll show the name of the person that first introduced that line and, quite probably, wrote it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or maybe, even better, get the changelog and the names of who touched a specific line of code with <em>git-log</em> "-L" option:</p>
