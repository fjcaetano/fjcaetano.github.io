One of these days I needed a _debounce_ on Swift to ensure some block of code
would only be executed once in a period of time. _Debounces_ are quite simple so
I implemented a first draft of it.

Not long after that, I also needed a _throttle_ to skip repetitive calls to a
different block of code. Not too different from a _debouce_, but not quite the
same.

Bouncing around in the interwebs (pun intended), searching for a simple
implementation for _throttle_, [all][] [I][] [could][] [find][] [was][]
[nonsense][]... and
overcomplicated.

So I created an extension on `DispatchQueue` (where it should be):
