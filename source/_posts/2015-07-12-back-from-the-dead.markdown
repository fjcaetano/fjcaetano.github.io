Finally! After long overdue, this lovely little blog has been updated. And
upgraded. From one press to another. So long Wordpress, hello Octopress! And
we're now hosted on Github. So, if I ever get lucky and have a truly successful
post, there's no need to worry with the blog being down.

<!-- more -->

Anyways, this is just a note to get you on your toes for what's coming. True
updates will arrive shortly.

P.S. I'm using the [HPSTR](https://github.com/jez/hpstr-theme/){:target="_blank"} theme and I'm
still getting around it, but all the feature images you may see here from now on
are my own. I'll try and remember to link them to a bigger picture.
