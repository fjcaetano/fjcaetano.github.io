<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone that have recently developed any pods for Cocoapods know that resources should be gathered using the <a href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#resource_bundles" target="_blank"><code>resource_bundles</code></a> option. What is quite hard to figure out is how, exactly, to access those resources once they're set up in the <em>bundle</em>. It seems obvious now that I got it working, but I struggle a lot since there wasn't anything in Stackoverflow or anywhere else that provided the answer I came up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After setting up the <code>resource_bundles</code>, Cocoapods copies the resources found in a "resources" folder within the Pods project, but none of them are added in the target's "Copy bundle resources". For that reason, I couldn't access any of the Pod's images or <em>xibs</em> in my project. Every time XCode threw me this error:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><code>'Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Could not load NIB in bundle:<{PATH_TO_APP}> (loaded)' with name '{VIEW_CONTROLLER_NAME}'</code></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The obvious solution that wasn't listed anywhere is using the Cocoapods generated bundle (which the folder actually doesn't exist) as a <code>NSBundle</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSString *bundlePath             = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"MyBundle" ofType:@"bundle"];

NSBundle *bundle                 = [NSBundle bundleWithPath:bundlePath];

MyViewController *viewController = [[MyViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MyViewController" bundle:bundle];

[self.navigationController pushViewController:viewController animated:YES];</pre>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it's that simple, that obvious, though it's not listed anywhere. I believe to be prudent and convenient to write about it in order to help anyone who encounter themselves in the same situation as I did.</p>
