<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi there, stranger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you found this blog, you're probably my friend or already know what I do for a living. But anyways I'm a mobile app developer (I mean, iOS developer), Python fan and Django explorer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this blog, which I'll try to update at least once a month, I'll primarily talk about my approaches in some aspects of my developer life, but if I digress and start talking about karting, movies, cooking or anything, please, bare with me for I'll eventually come back to topic -- or not. Those are some of my current hobbies and, in the future, more wil come and some will be forgotten.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That's me. Oh, btw, my name is Flávio (duh!), I'm 22 brazilian and you can reach me at <a href="mailto:flavio@vieiracaetano.com">flavio@vieiracaetano.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are some of my links you may find interesting:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><a href="https://github.com/fjcaetano">Github Profile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://flaviocaetano.com">Personal Page</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That's it for now. Soon will finish the next article I'm currently working on and, when I'm satisfied -- which will probably be never, but I'll post it anyway -- we'll talk more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you next time.</p>
